OBJECTIVE	To determine the perceived risk of type 2 diabetes in a sample of healthy middle-aged adults and examine the association between perceived risk and modelled risk , clinical risk factors , and psychological factors theorised to be antecedents of behaviour change .
METHODS	An exploratory , cross-sectional analysis of perceived risk of type 2 diabetes ( framed according to time and in comparison with peers ) was conducted using baseline data collected from 569 participants of the Diabetes Risk Communication Trial ( Cambridgeshire , UK ) .
METHODS	Type 2 diabetes risk factors were measured during a health assessment and the Framingham Offspring Diabetes Risk Score was used to model risk .
METHODS	Questionnaires assessed psychological factors including anxiety , diabetes-related worry , behavioural intentions , and other theory-based antecedents of behaviour change .
METHODS	Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine associations between perceived risk and potential correlates .
RESULTS	Participants with a high perceived risk were at higher risk according to the Framingham Offspring Diabetes Risk Score ( p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	Higher perceived risk was observed in those with a higher body fat percentage , lower self-rated health , higher diabetes-related worry , and lower self-efficacy for adhering to governmental recommendations for physical activity ( all p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	The framing of perceived risk according to time and in comparison with peers did not influence these results .
CONCLUSIONS	High perceived risk of type 2 diabetes is associated with higher risk of developing the disease , and a decreased likelihood of engagement in risk-reducing health behaviours .
CONCLUSIONS	Risk communication interventions should target high-risk individuals with messages about the effectiveness of prevention strategies .

BACKGROUND	Although multivitamins are widely used , there are limited prospective studies investigating their association with both long - and short-term risk of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) .
OBJECTIVE	The objective was to investigate how multivitamin use is associated with the long - and short-term risk of CVD .
METHODS	A prospective cohort study was conducted of 37,193 women from the Women 's Health Study aged 45 y and free of CVD and cancer at baseline who were followed for an average of 16.2 y.
METHODS	At baseline , women self-reported a wide range of lifestyle , clinical , and dietary factors .
METHODS	Women were categorized into 1 ) no current use and 2 ) current use of multivitamins .
METHODS	Duration and updated measures over the course of the follow-up to address short-term effects were also considered .
METHODS	Women were followed for major CVD events , including myocardial infarction ( MI ) , stroke , and CVD death .
RESULTS	During the follow-up , 1493 incident cases of CVD [ defined as myocardial infarction ( MI ) , stroke , and CVD death ] occurred .
RESULTS	In multivariable analyses , multivitamin use compared with no use was not associated with major CVD events ( HR : 1.01 ; 95 % CI : 0.89 , 1.15 ) , MI ( HR : 1.04 ; 95 % CI : 0.84 , 1.27 ) , stroke ( HR : 0.99 ; 95 % CI : 0.83 , 1.18 ) , or CVD death ( HR : 1.10 ; 95 % CI : 0.84 , 1.45 ) .
RESULTS	A nonsignificant inverse association was observed between baseline multivitamin use and major CVD events among women aged 70 y ( P-interaction = 0.04 ) and those consuming < 3 servings/d of fruit and vegetables ( P-interaction = 0.01 ) .
RESULTS	When updating information on multivitamin use during the course of follow-up , no associations were observed for major CVD events ( HR : 0.91 ; 95 % CI : 0.82 , 1.02 ) , MI ( HR : 0.89 ; 95 % CI : 0.74 , 1.06 ) , stroke ( HR : 0.91 ; 95 % CI : 0.78 , 1.06 ) , and CVD death ( HR : 0.91 ; 95 % CI : 0.71 , 1.16 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In this study of middle-aged and elderly women , neither baseline nor time-varying multivitamin use was associated with the long-term risk of major CVD events , MI , stroke , cardiac revascularizations , or CVD death .
CONCLUSIONS	Additional studies are needed to clarify the role of multivitamins on CVD .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the immediate effects of electroacupuncture and manual acupuncture on pain , mobility and muscle strength in patients with knee osteoarthritis .
METHODS	Sixty patients with knee osteoarthritis , with a pain intensity of 2 on the pain Numerical Rating Scale , were included .
METHODS	The patients were randomised into two groups : manual acupuncture and electroacupuncture .
METHODS	Pain intensity , degree of dysfunction ( Timed Up and Go ( TUG ) test ) , maximal voluntary isometric contraction and pressure pain threshold were assessed before and after a single session of manual acupuncture or electroacupuncture treatments .
RESULTS	Both groups showed a significant reduction in pain intensity ( p < 0.001 ) and time to run the TUG test after the acupuncture treatment ( p = 0.005 for the manual acupuncture group and p = 0.002 for the electroacupuncture group ) .
RESULTS	There were no differences between the groups regarding pain intensity ( p = 0.25 ) , TUG test ( p = 0.70 ) , maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( p = 0.43 ) or pressure pain threshold ( p = 0.27 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study found no difference between the immediate effects of a single session of manual acupuncture and electroacupuncture on pain , muscle strength and mobility in patients with knee osteoarthritis .

BACKGROUND	The duration between first symptom and a cancer diagnosis is important because , if shortened , may lead to earlier stage diagnosis and improved cancer outcomes .
BACKGROUND	We have previously developed a tool to measure this duration in newly-diagnosed patients .
BACKGROUND	In this two-phase study , we aimed further improve our tool and to conduct a trial comparing levels of anxiety between two modes of delivery : self-completed versus researcher-administered .
METHODS	In phase 1 , ten patients completed the modified tool and participated in cognitive debrief interviews .
METHODS	In phase 2 , we undertook a Randomised Controlled Trial ( RCT ) of the revised tool ( Cancer Symptom Interval Measure ( C-SIM ) ) in three hospitals for 11 different cancers .
METHODS	Respondents were invited to provide either exact or estimated dates of first noticing symptoms and presenting them to primary care .
METHODS	The primary outcome was anxiety related to delivery mode , with completeness of recording as a secondary outcome .
METHODS	Dates from a subset of patients were compared with GP records .
RESULTS	After analysis of phase 1 interviews , the wording and format were improved .
RESULTS	In phase 2 , 201 patients were randomised ( 93 self-complete and 108 researcher-complete ) .
RESULTS	Anxiety scores were significantly lower in the researcher-completed group , with a mean rank of 83.5 ; compared with the self-completed group , with a mean rank of 104.0 ( Mann-Whitney U = 3152 , p = 0.007 ) .
RESULTS	Completeness of data was significantly better in the researcher-completed group , with no statistically significant difference in time taken to complete the tool between the two groups .
RESULTS	When comparing the dates in the patient questionnaires with those in the GP records , there was evidence in the records of a consultation on the same date or within a proscribed time window for 32/37 ( 86 % ) consultations ; for estimated dates there was evidence for 23/37 consultations ( 62 % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	We have developed and tested a tool for collecting patient-reported data relating to appraisal intervals , help-seeking intervals , and diagnostic intervals in the cancer diagnostic pathway for 11 separate cancers , and provided evidence of its acceptability , feasibility and validity .
CONCLUSIONS	This is a useful tool to use in descriptive and epidemiological studies of cancer diagnostic journeys , and causes less anxiety if administered by a researcher .

BACKGROUND	Radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation has been associated with some risk of thromboembolic events .
BACKGROUND	Previous studies showed that preventive short episodes of forearm ischemia ( remote ischemic preconditioning [ IPC ] ) reduce exercise-induced platelet reactivity .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we assessed whether remote IPC has any effect on platelet activation induced by radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation .
RESULTS	We randomized 19 patients ( age , 54.711 years ; 17 male ) undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to receive remote IPC or sham intermittent forearm ischemia ( control subjects ) before the procedure .
RESULTS	Blood venous samples were collected before and after remote IPC/sham ischemia , at the end of the ablation procedure , and 24 hours later .
RESULTS	Platelet activation and reactivity were assessed by flow cytometry by measuring monocyte-platelet aggregate formation , platelet CD41 in the monocyte-platelet aggregate gate , and platelet CD41 and CD62 in the platelet gate in the absence and presence of ADP stimulation .
RESULTS	At baseline , there were no differences between groups in platelet variables .
RESULTS	Radiofrequency ablation induced platelet activation in both groups , which persisted after 24 hours .
RESULTS	However , compared with control subjects , remote IPC patients showed a lower increase in all platelet variables , including monocyte-platelet aggregate formation ( P < 0.0001 ) , CD41 in the monocyte-platelet aggregate gate ( P = 0.002 ) , and CD41 ( P < 0.0001 ) and CD62 ( P = 0.002 ) in the platelet gate .
RESULTS	Compared with control subjects , remote IPC was also associated with a significantly lower ADP-induced increase in all platelet markers .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data show that remote IPC before radiofrequency catheter ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation significantly reduces the increased platelet activation and reactivity associated with the procedure .

OBJECTIVE	To analyse if social capital modifies the effect of educational intervention of home visitors on mobility disability .
OBJECTIVE	Earlier studies have found that educational intervention of home visitors has a positive effect of older peoples ' functional decline , but how social capital might modify this effect is still unknown .
METHODS	We used the Danish Intervention Study on Preventive Home Visits - a prospective cohort study including 2863 75-year-olds and 1171 80-year-olds in 34 Danish municipalities - to analyse the modifying effect of different aspects of social capital on the effect of educational intervention of home visitors on functional decline .
METHODS	The three measures of social capital ( bonding , bridging , and linking ) were measured at contextual level .
METHODS	Data was analysed with multivariate linear regression model using generalised estimating equations to account for repeated measurements .
RESULTS	We found that 80-year-olds living in municipalities with high bonding ( B = 0.089 , p = 0.0279 ) and high linking ( B = 0.0929 ; p = 0.0217 ) had significant better mobility disability in average at 3-year follow up if their municipality had received intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	With the unique design of the Danish Intervention Study on Preventive Home Visits and with theory-based measures of social capital that distinguish between three aspects of social capital with focus on older people , this study contributes to the literature about the role of social capital for interventions on mobility disability .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of preoperative psychological intervention on alleviating negative emotions in patients undergoing emergent ocular trauma surgery .
METHODS	A total of 100 patients undergoing emergent ocular trauma surgery were selected using convenience sampling and randomly divided into control ( n = 49 ) and experimental ( n = 51 ) groups .
METHODS	Patients in the control group received conventional nursing and their counterparts in the observation group were treated with individualized psychological interventions including psychological support , relaxation training , and humanistic care based on conventional nursing care .
METHODS	Self-rating anxiety scale ( SAS ) , self-rating depression scale ( SDS ) , and fear visual analog scale ( FVAS ) scores were statistically compared between the two groups .
RESULTS	The scores of SAS , SDS , and FAVS were significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group ( all P < 0.001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Comprehensive psychological intervention effectively eliminates negative emotions in patients undergoing emergent ocular trauma surgery and accelerates their physical and mental recovery .

BACKGROUND	Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) - mediated angiogenesis plays an important role in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .
BACKGROUND	Ramucirumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits VEGF receptor 2 .
BACKGROUND	This phase 2 study investigated ramucirumab in combination with first-line pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy in advanced/metastatic NSCLC .
METHODS	Eligible stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC patients with no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized 1:1 to pemetrexed and carboplatin ( or cisplatin ) or ramucirumab ( 10 mg/kg ) plus pemetrexed and carboplatin ( or cisplatin ) once every 3 weeks .
METHODS	Treatment was given for 4 to 6 cycles , and this was followed by a maintenance phase with pemetrexed or ramucirumab and pemetrexed .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ( PFS ) with a sample size of sufficient power to detect an increase from 7 to 10.4 months .
RESULTS	From October 2010 to October 2011 , 140 patients were randomized ( pemetrexed-platinum arm , 71 ; ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arm , 69 ) , and most baseline characteristics were similar for the 2 treatment arms .
RESULTS	The median PFS was 5.6 months for the pemetrexed-platinum arm and 7.2 months for the ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arm ( hazard ratio , 0.75 ; P = .132 ) .
RESULTS	The objective response rates were 38.0 % and 49.3 % for the pemetrexed-platinum and ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arms , respectively ( P = .180 ) .
RESULTS	The disease control rate was 70.4 % for the pemetrexed-platinum arm and 85.5 % for the ramucirumab-pemetrexed-platinum arm ( P = .032 ) .
RESULTS	The grade 3 or higher adverse events occurring in 10 % or more of patients were thrombocytopenia , neutropenia , fatigue , anemia , nausea , back pain , and hypertension .
CONCLUSIONS	The primary endpoint of significant prolongation of PFS was not met ; however , ramucirumab showed evidence of clinical activity in combination with pemetrexed and platinum in nonsquamous NSCLC patients .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of ramucirumab to pemetrexed and platinum did not result in new or unexpected safety findings .

OBJECTIVE	To combine multiple Heidelberg Retina Tomograph ( HRT ) parameters using the Random Forests classifier to diagnose glaucoma , both in highly and physiologically myopic ( highly myopic ) eyes and emmetropic eyes .
METHODS	Subjects consisted of healthy subjects and age-matched patients with open-angle glaucoma in emmetropic ( -1.0 to +1.0 diopters [ D ] , 63 and 59 subjects , respectively ) and highly myopic eyes ( -10.0 to -5.0 D , 56 and 64 subjects , respectively ) .
METHODS	First , area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC ) was derived using 84 HRT global and sectorial parameters and the representative HRT raw parameter ( largest AUC ) was identified .
METHODS	Then , the Random Forests method was carried out using age , refractive error , and 84 HRT parameters .
METHODS	The AUCs were also derived using the following : ( 1 ) Frederick S. Mikelberg discriminant function ( FSM ) score , ( 2 ) Reinhard O.W. Burk discriminant function ( RB ) score , ( 3 ) Moorfields regression analysis ( MRA ) score , and ( 4 ) glaucoma probability score ( GPS ) .
RESULTS	In combined emmetropic and highly myopic population , AUC with Random Forests method ( 0.96 ) was significantly larger than AUCs with the representative HRT raw parameter ( vertical cup-to-disc ratio [ global ] , 0.89 ) , FSM ( 0.90 ) , RB ( 0.83 ) , MRA ( 0.87 ) , and GPS ( 0.81 ) ( P < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , AUC with the Random Forests method was significantly ( P < 0.05 ) larger than these other parameters , both in emmetropic and highly myopic groups .
RESULTS	Also , the Random Forests method achieved partial AUCs above 80 % / 90 % significantly ( P < 0.05 ) larger than any other HRT parameters in all populations .
CONCLUSIONS	Evaluating multiple HRT parameters using the Random Forests classifier provided accurate diagnosis of glaucoma , both in emmetropic and highly myopic eyes .

BACKGROUND	Dengue virus is the most serious mosquito-borne viral threat to public health and no vaccines or antiviral therapies are approved for dengue fever .
BACKGROUND	The tetravalent DENVax vaccine contains a molecularly characterised live attenuated dengue serotype-2 virus ( DENVax-2 ) and three recombinant vaccine viruses expressing the prM and E structural genes for serotypes 1 , 3 , and 4 in the DENVax-2 genetic backbone .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of tetravalent DENVax formulations .
METHODS	We undertook a randomised , double-blind , phase 1 , dose-escalation trial between Oct 11 , 2011 , and Nov 9 , 2011 , in the Rionegro , Antioquia , Colombia .
METHODS	The first cohort of participants ( aged 18-45 years ) were randomly assigned centrally , via block randomisation , to receive a low-dose formulation of DENvax , or placebo , by either subcutaneous or intradermal administration .
METHODS	After a safety assessment , participants were randomly assigned to receive a high-dose DENVax formulation , or placebo , by subcutaneous or intradermal administration .
METHODS	Group assignment was not masked from study pharmacists , but allocation was concealed from participants , nurses , and investigators .
METHODS	Primary endpoints were frequency and severity of injection-site and systemic reactions within 28 days of each vaccination .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints were the immunogenicity of DENVax against all four dengue virus serotypes , and the viraemia due to each of the four vaccine components after immunisation .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat for safety and per protocol for immunogenicity .
METHODS	Because of the small sample size , no detailed comparison of adverse event rates were warranted .
METHODS	The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01224639 .
RESULTS	We randomly assigned 96 patients to one of the four study groups : 40 participants ( 42 % ) received low-dose vaccine and eight participants ( 8 % ) received placebo in the low-dose groups ; 39 participants ( 41 % ) received high-dose vaccine , with nine ( 9 % ) participants assigned to receive placebo .
RESULTS	Both formulations were well tolerated with mostly mild and transient local or systemic reactions .
RESULTS	No clinically meaningful differences were recorded in the overall incidence of local and systemic adverse events between patients in the vaccine and placebo groups ; 68 ( 86 % ) of 79 participants in the vaccine groups had solicited systemic adverse events compared with 13 ( 76 % ) of 17 of those in the placebo groups .
RESULTS	By contrast , 67 participants ( 85 % ) in the vaccine group had local solicited reactions compared with five ( 29 % ) participants in the placebo group .
RESULTS	Immunisation with either high-dose or low-dose DENVax formulations induced neutralising antibody responses to all four dengue virus serotypes ; 30 days after the second dose , 47 ( 62 % ) of 76 participants given vaccine seroconverted to all four serotypes and 73 ( 96 % ) participants seroconverted to three or more dengue viruses .
RESULTS	Infectious DENVax viruses were detected in only ten ( 25 % ) of 40 participants in the low-dose group and 13 ( 33 % ) of 39 participants in the high-dose group .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings emphasise the acceptable tolerability and immunogenicity of the tetravalent DENVax formulations in healthy , flavivirus-naive adults .
CONCLUSIONS	Further clinical testing of DENVax in different age groups and in dengue-endemic areas is warranted .
BACKGROUND	Takeda Vaccines .

METHODS	Besides , another 30 healthy children were recruited as the healthy control group .
METHODS	Patients in the NG group were treated with NG ( consisting of all gastrodia rhizome , Codonopsis pilosula , Ophiopogon japonicus , white peony root , Rhinocerotidae , oyster , earthworm , licorice root , etc. ) , one dose daily , administered by dissolving it in boiled water , taken in two portions in the morning and in the evening respectively .
METHODS	Patients in the Tiapride group took Tiapride Tablet , 50 -100 mg each time , twice daily .
METHODS	The dosage was adjusted according to individual difference and changes of pathogenic conditions .
METHODS	The maximal dosage was 300 mg per day .
METHODS	Those in the combined treatment group were treated with equal dose of NG and Tiapride Tablet in combination .
METHODS	The treatment course was 3 months for all .
METHODS	Changes of pathogenic condition before and after treatment were assessed by Yale global tic severity scale ( YGTSS ) .
METHODS	Serum levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha were detected by enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) before and after treatment .
RESULTS	( 1 ) The total effective rate of the NG group , the combined treatment group , and the Tiapride group was 79.3 % , 83.3 % , and 67.9 % , respectively .
RESULTS	It was the lowest in the Tiapride group ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	It was significantly higher in the combined treatment group than in the NG group ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	( 2 ) The post-treatment YGTSS score was obviously lower in each group after treatment than before treatment ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	The posttreatment YGTSS score was obviously lower in the NG group and the combined treatment group than in the Tiapride group ( P < 0.05 ) , but with no statistical difference between the fromer two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	( 3 ) Compared with the healthy control group before treatment , serum levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha ( pg/mL ) were 124.95 + / - 22.78 and 209.52 + / - 21.69 in the NG group , 126.14 + / - 25.65 and 208.97 + / - 22.46 in the combined treatment group , 123.00 + / - 24.26 and 205.10 + / - 26.16 in the Tiapride group , being higher than those in the healthy control group ( 64.56 + / - 27.59 and 78.13 + / - 33.42 ; P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	After treatment , serum levels of of IL-12 and TNF-alpha were 104.67 + / - 16.84 and 183.01 + / - 24.95 in the NG group , 109.04 + / - 16.81 and 179.87 + / - 23.45 in the combined treatment group , significantly lower than before treatment ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	But there was no statistical difference in serum levels of IL-12 or TNF-alpha in the Tiapride group between before treatment ( 123.00 + / - 24.26 and 205.10 + / - 26.16 ) and after treatment ( 117.75 + / - 16.79 and 199.76 + / - 33.21 ; P > 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	NG could modulate abnormal serum levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha in TS children patients , which might be one of its pharmacodynamic mechanisms for treating TS .

OBJECTIVE	Two double-blind , randomized studies were conducted to assess the tolerability , pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral TA-8995 , a new cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) inhibitor , in healthy subjects .
METHODS	Study 1 : Subjects received single doses of TA-8995 or placebo ( fasted ) .
METHODS	Doses were 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 ( fed/fasted ) , 100 and 150mg ( Caucasian males , 18-55years ) , 25mg ( Caucasian males , > 65years and Caucasian females , 18-55years ) , 25 , 50 , 100 and 150mg ( Japanese males , 18-55years ) .
METHODS	Study 2 : Caucasian males ( 18-55years ) received 1 , 2.5 , 10 or 25mg once daily TA-8995 or placebo for 21-28days .
METHODS	Blood and urine for pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics were collected .
METHODS	Tolerability was assessed by adverse events , vital signs , electrocardiograms and laboratory safety tests .
RESULTS	Peak TA-8995 concentrations occurred approximately 4h post-dose .
RESULTS	Mean half-lives ranged from 81 to 166h , without an obvious dose relationship .
RESULTS	Exposure increased less than proportionally to dose .
RESULTS	TA-8995 was not excreted in urine .
RESULTS	Following 2.5 to 25mg once daily dosing , TA-8995 demonstrated nearly complete inhibition of CETP activity ( 92-99 % ) , increased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( HDL-C ) by 96 to 140 % and decreased low density liporotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) by 40 % to 53 % .
RESULTS	There were dose-related increases in apolipoproteins A-1 and E , HDL2-C and HDL3-C , and decreases in apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A.
RESULTS	There was no evidence of significant effects of age , gender , ethnicity or food on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics .
RESULTS	All doses were well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	TA-8995 is a potent CETP inhibitor and warrants further investigation .

BACKGROUND	Limited data exist regarding the efficacy of metoclopramide in the treatment of intractable hiccups .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to assess the feasibility efficacy of metoclopramide in the treatment of patients with intractable hiccups .
METHODS	A total of 36 patients with intractable hiccups was randomly assigned to arm A ( n = 18 ) or arm B ( n = 18 ) in a multicentre , double-blind , randomised , controlled pilot study .
METHODS	Participants in arm A received 10-mg metoclopramide thrice daily for 15 days , whereas those assigned to arm B received 10-mg placebo thrice daily for 15 days .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was total efficacy against hiccups ( including cessation and improvement of hiccups ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures included a comparison of overall efficacy and adverse events between the two arms .
RESULTS	Of the 36 patients enrolled , 34 participants completed the study .
RESULTS	The total efficacy was higher in arm A than in arm B ( relative risk , 2.75 ; 95 % confidence interval : 1.09-6 .94 , P = 0.03 ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , comparison between the two arms revealed that overall efficacy was higher in arm A than that in arm B ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	No serious adverse events related to the treatment were documented in either arm .
RESULTS	The most common adverse events occurring in patients in arm A included fatigue , upset mood and dizziness .
CONCLUSIONS	Metoclopramide appears to be a promising candidate for the treatment of patients with intractable hiccups , with mild adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	However , further clinical trials are required to confirm these results .

BACKGROUND	Plain packaging requires tobacco products to be sold in packs with a standard shape , method of opening and colour , leaving the brand name in a standard font and location .
BACKGROUND	We ran a randomised controlled trial to investigate the impact of plain packaging on smoking behaviour and attitudes .
METHODS	In a parallel group randomised trial design , 128 daily smokers smoked cigarettes from their usual UK brand , or a plain Australian brand that was closely matched to their usual UK brand for 24 hours .
METHODS	Primary outcomes were number of cigarettes smoked and volume of smoke inhaled per cigarette .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were self-reported ratings of motivation to quit , cigarette taste , experience of using the pack , experience of smoking , attributes of the pack , perceptions of the health warning , changes in smoking behaviour , and views on plain packaging .
RESULTS	There was no evidence that pack type had an effect on either of the primary measures ( ps > 0.279 ) .
RESULTS	However , smokers using plain cigarette packs rated the experience of using the pack more negatively ( -0.52 , 95 % CI -0.82 to -0.22 , p = 0.001 ) , rated the pack attributes more negatively ( -1.59 , 95 % CI -1.80 to -1.39 , p < 0.001 ) , and rated the health warning as more impactful ( +0.51 , 95 % CI 0.24 to 0.78 , p < 0.001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Plain cigarette packs reduce ratings of the experience of using the cigarette pack , and ratings of the pack attributes , and increase the self-perceived impact of the health warning , but do not change smoking behaviour , at least in the short term .

BACKGROUND	Until now , working memory training has not reached sufficient evidence as effective treatment for ADHD core symptoms in children with ADHD ; for young children with ADHD , no studies are available .
BACKGROUND	To this end , a triple-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled study was designed to assess the efficacy of Cogmed Working Memory Training ( CWMT ) in young children with ADHD .
METHODS	Fifty-one children ( 5-7years ) with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of ADHD ( without current psychotropic medication ) were randomly assigned to the active ( adaptive ) or placebo ( nonadaptive ) training condition for 25 sessions during 5 weeks .
METHODS	The compliance criterion ( > 20 sessions ) was met for 47 children .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure concerned the core behavioural symptoms of ADHD , measured with the ADHD Rating Scale IV ( ADHD-RS ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures were neurocognitive functioning , daily executive functioning , and global clinical functioning .
METHODS	The influence of the increase in difficulty level ( Index-Improvement ) for the treatment group was also analysed .
METHODS	Clinical trial registration information - ` Working Memory Training in Young ADHD Children ' ; www.clinicaltrials.gov ; NCT00819611 .
RESULTS	A significant improvement in favour of the active condition was found on a verbal working memory task ( p = .041 ; adapted Digit Span WISC-III , backward condition ) .
RESULTS	However , it did not survive correction for multiple testing .
RESULTS	No significant treatment effect on any of the primary or other secondary outcome measurements was found .
RESULTS	The Index-Improvement significantly contributed to ADHD-RS and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function , both rated by the teacher , but revealed no significant group difference .
CONCLUSIONS	This study failed to find robust evidence for benefits of CMWT over the placebo training on behavioural symptoms , neurocognitive , daily executive , and global clinical functioning in young children with ADHD .

BACKGROUND	In our previous randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) , we have shown in preterm babies ( PBs ) < 30weeks gestation that CeasIng Cpap At standarD criteriA ( CICADA ( method 1 ) ) compared with cycling off continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) gradually ( method 2 ) or cycling off CPAP gradually with low flow air/oxygen during periods off CPAP ( method 3 ) reduces CPAP cessation time in PBs < 30weeks gestation .
METHODS	This retrospective study reviewed weight gain , time to reach full feeds and time to cease caffeine in PBs previously enrolled in the RCT .
RESULTS	Data were collected from 162 of the 177 PBs , and there was no significant difference in the projected weight gain between the three methods .
RESULTS	Based on intention to treat , the time taken to reach full feeds for all three methods showed no significant difference .
RESULTS	However , post hoc analysis showed the CICADA method compared with cycling off gradually just failed significance ( 30.31.6 vs 31.12.4 ( weeks corrected gestational age ( Wks CGASD ) ) , p = 0.077 ) .
RESULTS	Analysis of time to cease caffeine showed there was a significant difference between the methods with PBs randomised to the CICADA method compared with the cycling off method ceasing caffeine almost a week earlier ( 33.62.4 vs 34.52.8 ( Wks CGASD ) , p = 0.02 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This retrospective study provides evidence to substantiate the optimum method of ceasing CPAP ; the CICADA method , does not adversely affect weight gain , time to reach full feeds and may reduce time to cease caffeine in PBs < 30weeks gestation .

BACKGROUND	The effect of intracoronary adenosine ( ADO ) on ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) size and adverse remodeling is not well established .
METHODS	In a double-blind trial , 201 patients with STEMI were randomized to receive percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) within 6 hours of symptom onset , 4.5 mg ADO or saline immediately prior to reperfusion .
METHODS	Primary end-point : percentage of total myocardial necrotic mass by cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) 2-7 days post-reperfusion .
METHODS	Secondary end-points : changes in left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction ( LVEF ) at baseline and at 6 months .
RESULTS	Baseline CMR could not be performed in 20 patients .
RESULTS	Overall , no significant differences were observed between ADO and placebo regarding infarct size ( 20.8 % vs. 22.5 % ; p = 0.40 ) .
RESULTS	However , infarct size was significantly reduced ( 19.4 % vs. 25.7 % ; p for interaction = 0.031 ) in those with ischemia duration below the median ( 200 min ) .
RESULTS	CMR at 6 months , performed in 138 patients , did not show statistically significant differences between groups in the rate of LVEF increase ( 3.3 units ( SD 9.6 ) in ADO group vs. 1.5 units ( SD 9 ) in placebo group ; p = 0.25 ) .
RESULTS	In the subgroup analysis , among patients with ischemia time below 200 min , the increase in LVEF was slightly higher with ADO ( 3.59 % vs. 0.43 % ; p for interaction = 0.06 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although our study failed to demonstrate that intracoronary administration of ADO prior to PCI limits infarct size , in patients receiving early PCI ADO might enhance myocardial salvage and has a favorable effect on LVEF evolution , which may help to reconcile apparently contradictory results of previous studies .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate aripiprazole once-monthly ( AOM ) , a long-acting injectable suspension of aripiprazole , as acute treatment in patients with schizophrenia ( DSM-IV-TR ) .
METHODS	Adults experiencing an acute psychotic episode were randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with AOM 400 mg or placebo ( October 2012-August 2013 ) .
METHODS	The primary efficacy outcome was change from baseline to endpoint ( week 10 ) in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) total score .
METHODS	The key secondary efficacy outcome was change from baseline in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale ( CGI-S ) score .
METHODS	Secondary efficacy outcomes included change from baseline in PANSS positive and negative subscale and Personal and Social Performance Scale ( PSP ) scores .
METHODS	The study took place from October 2012 through August 2013 .
RESULTS	Patients ( N = 340 ; 79 % male , 66 % black ) were randomized to AOM ( n = 168 ) or placebo ( n = 172 ) .
RESULTS	Least squares ( LS ) mean change from baseline to endpoint ( week 10 ) favored AOM versus placebo in PANSS total ( treatment difference , -15.1 [ 95 % CI , -19.4 to -10.8 ] ; P < .0001 ) and CGI-S ( treatment difference , -0.8 [ 95 % CI , -1.1 to -0.6 ] ; P < .0001 ) scores , as it did at all other timepoints through 12 weeks ( all P .0005 ) .
RESULTS	LS mean change from baseline in PANSS positive and negative subscale and PSP scores favored AOM versus placebo ( P < .0001 ) .
RESULTS	Common ( > 10 % ) treatment-emergent adverse events ( AOM vs. placebo ) were increased weight ( 16.8 % vs 7.0 % ) , headache ( 14.4 % vs. 16.3 % ) , and akathisia ( 11.4 % vs 3.5 % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Symptoms and functioning improved with AOM 400 mg versus placebo in patients with acute schizophrenia , with acceptable safety and tolerability .
CONCLUSIONS	These data suggest that AOM 400 mg is a viable treatment option for patients experiencing an acute schizophrenia episode .
BACKGROUND	ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT01663532 .

OBJECTIVE	This study investigated the short-term effects of Kinesio taping ( KT ) on various types of pain , active range of motion ( AROM ) , and proprioception in patients with knee osteoarthritis .
METHODS	Forty-six older participants ( mean [ SD ] , 57.9 [ 4.4 ] yrs ) with osteoarthritis were randomly allocated to two groups : the KT group or the placebo-KT group .
METHODS	Taping with tension ( KT application ) or without tension ( placebo-KT application ) was applied to the quadriceps of the participants in both groups .
METHODS	Before and after intervention , pain intensity was measured using a visual analog scale at rest and during walking , and pressure pain thresholds ( PPTs ) were assessed using an algometer in the quadriceps and the tibialis anterior .
METHODS	In addition , pain-free AROM and proprioception were measured .
RESULTS	The KT group showed attenuation of pain during walking ( effect size [ ES ] , 1.97 ) , PPT in the quadriceps ( ES , 2.58 ) , and PPT in the tibialis anterior ( ES , 2.45 ) .
RESULTS	This group also showed significantly improved AROM ( ES , 2.01 ) and proprioception ( ES , 1.73-1 .89 ; P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	However , the placebo-KT group did not show significant changes in pain , AROM , or proprioception .
RESULTS	There were significant differences between the two groups in pain during walking and PPT .
RESULTS	In addition , pain during walking showed a significant correlation with AROM and proprioception , and a significant correlation was found between PPT and AROM .
CONCLUSIONS	These results demonstrated that KT application with proper tension to the quadriceps effectively attenuates various types of pain and improves AROM and proprioception in osteoarthritis patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , KT may be a suitable intervention to improve pain , AROM , and proprioception in patients with osteoarthritis in clinics .

OBJECTIVE	The literature on the relationship of depressive symptoms and stress hormones after cancer diagnosis has been mixed , with some studies showing a relationship and other studies showing none .
OBJECTIVE	Time since diagnosis may explain these contradictory findings .
OBJECTIVE	This study examined the relationship of depressive symptoms to stress hormones in patients with breast cancer using 12-month longitudinal data .
METHODS	Patients with Stage II or III breast cancer ( n = 227 ) were assessed every 4 months from diagnosis/surgery to 12 months .
METHODS	They completed the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) Iowa Short Form and the Perceived Stress Scale and blood samples were obtained to measure stress hormones ( i.e. , cortisol , adrenocorticotropin hormone , norepinephrine , and epinephrine ) .
RESULTS	Depressive symptoms were negatively related to cortisol levels ( = -0.023 , p = .002 ) but were positively related to rate of change in cortisol ( = 0.003 , p = .003 ) .
RESULTS	Adrenocorticotropin hormone , epinephrine , and norepinephrine did not covary with depressive symptoms ( all p values > .05 ) .
RESULTS	When the CES-D and Perceived Stress Scale were both used to predict cortisol , only the CES-D was significantly related ( = -0.025 , p = .017 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Depressive symptoms were negatively related to cortisol , but this relationship changed from the time of diagnosis/surgery through 12 months .
CONCLUSIONS	Cortisol may initially provide a buffering effect against depression during the stress of initial diagnosis and treatment , but this relationship seems to change over time .

BACKGROUND	Hematologic reference values vary by ethnicity .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to determine reference values of hemoglobin ( Hb ) for Korean adolescents .
METHODS	Using data from the 5th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( KNHANES ) , we obtained reference values for Hb in adolescents aged 10-20 years .
RESULTS	Among 2,526 subjects recruited , 330 were excluded due to chronic diseases ( 9 congenital heart disease , 6 epilepsy , and 1 thyroid disease ) or abnormal laboratory values ( 253 subjects with Fe/TIBC < 16 % , 103 subjects with MCV < 80fl ) .
RESULTS	Accordingly , data from 2,196 subjects ( male = 1,196 and female = 1,000 ) were analyzed and age - and gender-stratified means and percentile values of Hb were obtained .
RESULTS	Pertinent findings observed in the current study were : ( i ) Hb levels in Korean male were similar to those of non-Hispanic Caucasians ; ( ii ) Hb values in females were similar to those of non-Hispanic Caucasians until age of 15 , and thereafter were slightly lower .
RESULTS	Prevalence of anemia according to WHO criteria and our own criteria ( Hb levels < 2 standard deviations of age - and gender-specific values ) in total sample was 3.5 % ( 88/2 ,526 ) and 3.8 % ( 97/2 ,526 ) , respectively .
RESULTS	Anemia was more prevalent in female in comparison with male ( 6.5 % vs. 1.0 % , P < 0.001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results could be used as a national reference standard to correctly classify a large population sample .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are necessary to determine reference Hb values for children younger than 10 years and identify genetic variations associated with distinctive characteristics observed in this study .

BACKGROUND	Most tobacco smokers who wish to quit fail to reach their goal .
BACKGROUND	One important , insufficiently emphasized aspect of addiction relates to the decision-making system , often characterized by dysfunctional cognitive control and a powerful drive for reward .
BACKGROUND	Recent proof-of-principle studies indicate that transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) can transiently modulate processes involved in decision-making , and reduce substance intake and craving for various addictions .
BACKGROUND	We previously proposed that this beneficial effect of stimulation for reducing addictive behaviors is in part mediated by more reflective decision-making .
BACKGROUND	The goal of this study was to test whether nicotine intake and decision-making behaviors are modulated by tDCS over the DLPFC in tobacco smokers who wished to quit smoking .
METHODS	Subjects received two five-day tDCS regimens ( active or sham ) .
METHODS	Stimulation was delivered over the right DLPFC at a 2 mA during 30 min .
METHODS	Nicotine cravings , cigarette consumption and decision-making were assessed before and after each session .
RESULTS	Main findings include a significant decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked when participants received active as compared to sham stimulation .
RESULTS	This effect lasted up to four days after the end of the stimulation regimen .
RESULTS	In regards to decision-making , smokers rejected more often offers of cigarettes , but not offers of money , after they received active as compared to sham stimulation at the Ultimatum Game .
RESULTS	No significant change was observed at the Risk Task with cigarettes or money as rewards .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , these findings suggest that tDCS over the DLPFC may be beneficial for smoking reduction and induce reward sensitive effects .

BACKGROUND	Previous studies showed that noncoplanar intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( NC-IMRT ) for sinonasal cancer is superior to coplanar intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) .
BACKGROUND	Volumetric-modulated arc therapy ( VMAT ) is a newly introduced treatment modality , and the performance of noncoplanar VMAT for sinonasal cancer has not been well described to date .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the dosimetry difference of noncoplanar VMAT ( NC-VMAT ) , coplanar VMAT ( co-VMAT ) , and NC-IMRT for sinonasal cancer .
METHODS	Ten postoperative patients with sinonasal cancer were randomly selected for planning with NC-VMAT , co-VMAT , and NC-IMRT .
METHODS	Two planning target volumes ( PTVs ) were contoured representing high-risk and low-risk regions set to receive a median absorbed dose ( D50 % ) of 68 Gy and 59 Gy , respectively .
METHODS	The homogeneity index ( HI ) , conformity index ( CI ) , dose-volume histograms ( DVHs ) , and delivery efficiency were all evaluated .
RESULTS	Both NC-VMAT and co-VMAT showed superior dose homogeneity and conformity in PTVs compared with NC-IMRT .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between NC-VMAT and co-VMAT in PTV coverage .
RESULTS	Both VMAT plans provided a better protection for organs at risk ( OARs ) than NC-IMRT plans , and NC-VMAT showed a small improvement over co-VMAT in sparing of OARs .
RESULTS	For peripheral doses , the doses to breast , thyroid , and larynx in the NC-IMRT plans were significantly higher than those in both VMAT plans .
RESULTS	Compared to NC-VMAT , co-VMAT significantly reduced peripheral doses .
RESULTS	NC-VMAT and co-VMAT reduced the average delivery time by 63.2 and 64.2 % , respectively , in comparison with NC-IMRT .
RESULTS	No differences in delivery efficiency were observed between the two VMAT plans .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared to NC-VMAT , co-VMAT showed similar PTV coverage and comparable OAR sparing but significantly reduced peripheral doses and positioning uncertainty .
CONCLUSIONS	We propose to give priority to coplanar VMAT in the treatment of sinonasal cancer .

OBJECTIVE	There are no current pharmacological therapies for the prevention or treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome .
OBJECTIVE	Early dysregulated inflammation likely plays a role in acute respiratory distress syndrome development and possibly acute respiratory distress syndrome outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is central to the regulation of multiple inflammatory mediators implicated in acute organ dysfunction and is the target for a novel class of cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs .
OBJECTIVE	In preclinical models , p38 inhibitors reduce lung injury following pancreatitis and burn injury .
METHODS	We conducted a phase IIa , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of dilmapimod , a novel p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor , in patients at risk for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome admitted with an Injury Severity Score more than 16 , excluding head trauma .
METHODS	Enrolled patients received 4 - or 24-hour IV dilmapimod infusions at different doses or placebo , daily for 3 days , in four separate cohorts .
METHODS	Multicenter randomized clinical trial of large , academic trauma centers .
RESULTS	Seventy-seven patients were enrolled .
RESULTS	Although adverse events were common in this critically ill population , dilmapimod was well tolerated , with no clinically relevant safety findings .
RESULTS	Pharmacokinetic models indicated that the higher dose of 10mg given as continuous infusion over 24 hours had the most favorable plasma concentration profile .
RESULTS	Likewise , measures of soluble inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 , C-reactive peptide , interleukin-8 , and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 were most different between this dosing arm and placebo .
RESULTS	Although the study was not specifically designed with acute respiratory distress syndrome as an outcome , the number of patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome was small ( 2/77 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The novel p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor dilmapimod appears well tolerated and may merit further evaluation for prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome and other organ injury in larger clinical trials .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , results of this early-phase trial may aid in design of future studies aimed at prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome and other organ injury .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the effectiveness of two procedures increasing the botulinum toxin type A effect for wrist and finger flexor spasticity after stroke .
METHODS	A single-blind randomized trial .
METHODS	Seventy patients with upper limb post-stroke spasticity .
METHODS	Adults with wrist and finger flexor muscles spasticity after stroke were submitted to botulinum toxin type A therapy .
METHODS	After the treatment , the subjects injected were randomly divided into two groups and submitted to adhesive taping ( Group A ) or daily muscle manual stretching , passive articular mobilization of wrist and fingers , and palmar splint ( Group B ) for 10 days .
METHODS	We measured spasticity with Modified Ashworth Scale , related disability with Disability Assessment Scale , and fingers position at rest .
METHODS	The measurements were done at baseline , after two weeks , and after one month from the treatment session .
RESULTS	After two weeks , subjects in Group A reported a significantly greater decrease in spasticity scores ( Modified Ashworth Scale fingers : mean ( standard deviation ) 1.30.6 vs. 2.10.6 ; Modified Ashworth Scale wrist : 1.7 0.6 vs. 2.3 0.8 ) , and after one month in spasticity and disability scores ( Modified Ashworth Scale fingers : mean ( standard deviation ) 1.9 0.7 vs. 2.5 0.6 ; Modified Ashworth Scale wrist : 2.0 0.7 vs. 2.6 0.6 ; Disability Assessment Scale : 1.6 0.7 vs. 2.1 0.7 ) compared with Group B subjects .
RESULTS	Subjects in Group A reported also a significantly improved fingers position at rest compared with Group B subjects after two weeks ( 2.8 0.9 vs. 2.1 0.7 ) and one month ( 2.3 0.7 vs. 1.5 0.6 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Adhesive taping of wrist and finger flexor muscles appeared to enhance the effect of botulinum toxin type A therapy more than daily manual muscle stretching combined with passive articular mobilization and palmar splint .

BACKGROUND	Research has shown that 6h after breeding is a critical time during the uterine innate immune response , and the failure to respond appropriately will result in persistent breeding-induced endometritis .
BACKGROUND	This presents a potential opportunity to modulate the course of inflammation towards a timely resolution .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effects of immune modulation on endometrial mRNA expression of inflammatory genes in susceptible mares 6h after breeding .
OBJECTIVE	The hypothesis was that immune modulation alters endometrial cytokine expression in susceptible mares .
METHODS	A randomised controlled study to evaluate the effects of mycobacterial cell wall extract and dexamethasone on endometrial gene expression after insemination in 6 mares susceptible to persistent breeding-induced endometritis .
METHODS	Six susceptible mares were selected based on their uterine inflammatory response to insemination .
METHODS	Mares were inseminated during 3 oestrous cycles with 1 10 ( 9 ) nonviable spermatozoa and 1 ) no additional treatment ( control ) , or in combination with 2 ) dexamethasone ( 50mg i.v. ) at the time of insemination , or 3 ) with mycobacterial cell wall extract ( 1.5 ml i.v. ) administered 24h prior to insemination .
METHODS	Mares received one treatment per cycle in randomised order , and each mare served as her own control .
METHODS	Endometrial biopsies were collected 6h after breeding , and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis for interleukin ( IL ) 1 , IL6 , interferon , IL10 and IL1RA was performed .
METHODS	Relative quantification values reported fold changes in mRNA expression from the control .
METHODS	Data were analysed using an ANOVA and significance was set at P < 0.05 .
RESULTS	Expression of IL1 mRNA was lower after treatment with dexamethasone ( P < 0.001 ) and mycobacterial cell wall extract ( P < 0.05 ) when compared with control .
RESULTS	No differences were detected in the mRNA expression of the other cytokines after any of the treatments .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with immune modulators alters endometrial mRNA expression of IL1 after insemination .
CONCLUSIONS	A better understanding of the mechanisms of immune modulation in the equine uterus can help to improve treatments for persistent breeding-induced endometritis .

OBJECTIVE	Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) is often associated with severe pain .
OBJECTIVE	Different regional anesthetic techniques exist , all with varying degrees of motor blockade .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that pain relief provided by the adductor canal block ( ACB ) could increase functional muscle strength .
METHODS	We included 50 TKA patients with severe movement-related pain ; defined as having visual analog scale pain score of greater than 60 mm during active flexion of the knee .
METHODS	The ACB group received an ACB with ropivacaine 0.2 % 30 mL and a femoral nerve block ( FNB ) with 30 mL saline .
METHODS	The FNB group received an ACB with 30 mL saline and an FNB with ropivacaine 0.2 % 30 mL .
METHODS	We compared the effect of the ACB versus FNB on maximum voluntary isometric contraction of the quadriceps muscle relative to a postoperative baseline value .
METHODS	Secondary end points were differences between groups in ability to ambulate and changes in pain scores ( Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01922596 ) .
RESULTS	After block , the quadriceps maximum voluntary isometric contraction increased to 193 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 143-288 ) of the baseline value in the ACB group and decreased to 16 % ( 95 % CI , 3-33 ) in the FNB group with an estimated difference of 178 % ( 95 % CI , 136-226 ) , P < 0.0001 .
RESULTS	Pain scores were similar between groups .
RESULTS	Before block , 2 of 25 patients in each group were unable to perform the Timed-Up-and-Go test ; after block , this number increased to 7 of 25 in the FNB group and decreased to 0 of 25 in the ACB group .
CONCLUSIONS	Adductor canal block provides a clinically relevant and statistically significant increase in quadriceps muscle strength for patients in severe pain after TKA .

OBJECTIVE	To make a comprehensive evaluation of the efficiency of eradication therapy in patients with coronary heart disease ( CHD ) concurrent with peptic ulcer disease ( PUD ) .
METHODS	The results of treatment were studied in 112 patients with CHD concurrent with PUD who were randomized into 3 groups : 1 ) adequate eradication therapy during treatment for CHD ; 2 ) antisecretory therapy ; 3 ) treatment for CHD only .
METHODS	The trend in the clinical symptoms of the diseases and the results of an exercise test were assessed .
RESULTS	After eradication therapy , Group 1 patients displayed a reduction in the frequency of angina attacks by 62.6 % and weekly nitroglycerin needs by 70.4 % and an increase in exercise tolerance by 45.3 % .
RESULTS	In Group 2 patients on antisecretory therapy , the similar indicators changed by 30.7 , 21.2 , and 26.5 % , respectively .
RESULTS	Group 3 patients showed no significant change in the study indicators .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings suggest that eradication therapy has a positive impact on the course of CHD , which manifests itself as an antianginal effect and hence a change in the clinical picture .

OBJECTIVE	This paper examines the relationship between race , religiousness , spiritual well-being , antitumor treatment and preference for aggressive care among Black and White patients with advanced stage lung cancer receiving ambulatory cancer care in an urban setting .
METHODS	A cross-sectional exploration of patients enrolled in a Cleveland-based longitudinal study after initial diagnosis of advanced lung cancer were interviewed in Cleveland regarding religiousness , spiritual well-being , preferences for cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , goals of aggressive care , and willingness to tolerate adverse health states .
METHODS	Receipt of antitumor treatment was identified from medical records .
RESULTS	We analyzed data from 67 Black and 129 White patients ( N = 196 ) .
RESULTS	Regression analysis for CPR showed that race was not associated with preference for CPR ( OR = 1.12 , CI 0.44-2 .85 ) .
RESULTS	The odds of choosing CPR were three times higher among patients receiving antitumor treatment ( OR = 3.26 , CI 1.12-9 .44 ) .
RESULTS	Greater willingness to endure adverse health states was associated with higher spiritual well-being scores ( b = 0.12 , CI 0.01-0 .25 ) .
RESULTS	Choosing goals to extend life versus relieve pain was higher among persons with higher spiritual well-being as well ( RRR = 1.08 , CI 1.01-1 .16 ) , yet the relationship with religiousness was negative ( RRR = 0.46 , CI 0.22-0 .98 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	After controlling for multiple factors , race was associated only with CPR , but not with other measures of preference for aggressive care .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , receipt of active antitumor treatment was positively associated with preference for CPR and spiritual well-being was important to setting end-of-life care goals and perspectives .
CONCLUSIONS	Future directions for tailoring end-of-life care decision-making initiatives should move beyond race and discussions of CPR alone and focus on a full spectrum of patient beliefs and preferences at the end of life .

BACKGROUND	Continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion ( CIPII ) with an implantable pump is a treatment option for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) .
BACKGROUND	Aim of the present study was to describe the long-term course of glycaemic control , complications , health related quality of life ( HRQOL ) and treatment satisfaction among T1DM patients treated with CIPII .
METHODS	Nineteen patients that participated in a randomized cross-over trial comparing CIPII and subcutaneous ( SC ) therapy in 2006 were followed until 2012 .
METHODS	Laboratory , continuous glucose monitoring , HRQOL and treatment satisfaction measurements were performed at the start of the study , the end of the SC - , the end of the CIPII treatment phase in 2006 and during CIPII therapy in 2012 .
METHODS	Linear mixed models were used to calculate estimated values and to test differences between the moments in time .
RESULTS	In 2012 , more time was spent in hyperglycaemia than after the CIPII treatment phase in 2006 : 37 % ( 95 % CI 29 , 44 ) vs. 55 % ( 95 % CI 48 , 63 ) , mean difference 19.8 % ( 95 % CI 3.0 , 36.6 ) .
RESULTS	HbA1c was 65mmol/mol ( 95 % CI 60 , 71 ) at the end of the SC treatment phase in 2006 , 58mmol/mol ( 95 % CI 53 , 64 ) at the end of the CIPII treatment phase and 65mmol/mol ( 95 % CI 60 , 71 ) in 2012 , respectively ( p > 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	In 2012 , the median number of grade 2 hypoglycaemic events per week ( 1 ( 95 % CI 0 , 2 ) ) was still significantly lower than during prior SC therapy ( 3 ( 95 % CI 2 , 4 ) ) : mean change -1.8 ( 95 % CI -3.4 , -0.4 ) .
RESULTS	Treatment satisfaction with CIPII was better than with SC insulin therapy and HRQOL remained stable .
RESULTS	Pump or catheter dysfunction of the necessitated re-operation in 7 patients .
RESULTS	No mortality was reported .
CONCLUSIONS	After 6years of CIPII treatment , glycaemic regulation is stable and the number of hypoglycaemic events decreased compared to SC insulin therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment satisfaction with CIPII is superior to SC insulin therapy , HRQOL is stable and complications are scarce .
CONCLUSIONS	CIPII is a safe and effective treatment option for selected patients with T1DM , also on longer term .

BACKGROUND	Atelectasis is common during and after general anaesthesia .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that a ventilation strategy , without recruitment manoeuvres , using a combination of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) or positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) and a reduced end-expiratory oxygen fraction ( FETO2 ) before ending mask ventilation with CPAP after extubation would reduce the area of postoperative atelectasis .
METHODS	Thirty patients were randomized into three groups .
METHODS	During induction and emergence , inspiratory oxygen fractions ( FIO2 ) were 1.0 in the control group and 1.0 or 0.8 in the intervention groups .
METHODS	No CPAP/PEEP was used in the control group , whereas CPAP/PEEP of 6 cmH2O was used in the intervention groups .
METHODS	After extubation , FIO2 was set to 0.30 in the intervention groups and CPAP was applied , aiming at FETO2 < 0.30 .
METHODS	Atelectasis was studied by computed tomography 25 min postoperatively .
RESULTS	The median area of atelectasis was 5.2 cm ( 2 ) ( range 1.6-12 .2 cm ( 2 ) ) and 8.5 cm ( 2 ) ( 3-23 .1 cm ( 2 ) ) in the groups given FIO2 1.0 with or without CPAP/PEEP , respectively .
RESULTS	After correction for body mass index the difference between medians ( 2.9 cm ( 2 ) ) was statistically significant ( confidence interval 0.2-7 .6 cm ( 2 ) , p = 0.04 ) .
RESULTS	In the group given FIO2 0.8 , in which seven patients were ex - or current smokers , the median area of atelectasis was 8.2 cm ( 2 ) ( 1.8-14 .7 cm ( 2 ) ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with conventional ventilation , after correction for obesity , this ventilation strategy reduced the area of postoperative atelectasis in one of the intervention groups but not in the other group , which included a higher proportion of smokers .

BACKGROUND	Androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) is a cornerstone in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer .
BACKGROUND	Adverse musculoskeletal and cardiovascular effects of ADT are widely reported and investigations into the potential of exercise to ameliorate the effects of treatment are warranted .
BACKGROUND	The ` Football Club ( FC ) Prostate ' study is a randomized trial comparing the effects of soccer training with standard treatment approaches on body composition , cardiovascular function , physical function parameters , glucose tolerance , bone health , and patient-reported outcomes in men undergoing ADT for prostate cancer .
METHODS	Using a single-center randomized controlled design , 80 men with histologically confirmed locally advanced or disseminated prostate cancer undergoing ADT for 6months or more at The Copenhagen University Hospital will be enrolled on this trial .
METHODS	After baseline assessments eligible participants will be randomly assigned to a soccer training group or a control group receiving usual care .
METHODS	The soccer intervention will consist of 12weeks of training 2-3 times/week for 45-60min after which the assessment protocol will be repeated .
METHODS	Soccer training will then continue bi-weekly for an additional 20weeks at the end of which all measures will be repeated to allow for additional analyses of long-term effects .
METHODS	The primary endpoint is changes in lean body mass from baseline to 12weeks assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry scan .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints include changes of cardiovascular , metabolic , and physical function parameters , as well as markers of bone metabolism and patient-reported outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	The FC Prostate trial will assess the safety and efficacy of a novel soccer-training approach to cancer rehabilitation on a number of clinically important health outcomes in men with advanced prostate cancer during ADT .
CONCLUSIONS	The results may pave the way for innovative , community-based interventions in the approach to treating prostate cancer .

OBJECTIVE	Thiazolidinediones reduce ectopic fat , increase adiponectin and reduce inflammatory adipokines , fatty acids and glucose in people with Type 2 diabetes .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to measure these effects in people with impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance .
METHODS	After approximately 3.5 years of exposure to rosiglitazone 8 mg ( n = 88 ) or placebo ( n = 102 ) , 190 DREAM trial participants underwent abdominal computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans .
METHODS	Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue areas , estimated hepatic fat content , total fat and lean mass were calculated and changes in levels of fasting adipokines , free fatty acids , glucose and post-load glucose were assessed .
RESULTS	Compared with the placebo , participants on rosiglitazone had no difference in lean mass , had 4.1 kg more body fat ( P < 0.0001 ) and 31 cm ( 2 ) more subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue area ( P = 0.007 ) .
RESULTS	Only after adjusting for total fat , participants on rosiglitazone had 23 cm less visceral adipose tissue area ( P = 0.01 ) and an 0.08-unit higher liver : spleen attenuation ratio ( i.e. less hepatic fat ; P = 0.02 ) than those on the placebo .
RESULTS	Adiponectin increased by 15.0 g/ml with rosiglitazone and by 0.4 g/ml with placebo ( P < 0.0001 ) .
RESULTS	Rosiglitazone 's effect on fat distribution was not independent of changes in adiponectin .
RESULTS	Rosiglitazone 's effects on fasting ( -0.36 mmol/l ; P = 0.0004 ) and 2-h post-load glucose ( -1.21 mmol/l ; P = 0.0008 ) were not affected by adjustment for fat distribution or changes in adiponectin or free fatty acids .
CONCLUSIONS	In people with impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance , rosiglitazone is associated with relatively less hepatic and visceral fat , increased subcutaneous fat and increased adiponectin levels .
CONCLUSIONS	These effects do not appear to explain the glucose-lowering effect of rosiglitazone .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to compare the preperitoneal versus the preaponeurotic mesh positioning in open paraumbilical hernia repair .
METHODS	During the period from January 2011 until July 2012 , 60 adult patients were randomly assigned to two equal groups .
METHODS	The patients in group A were treated by preperitoneal mesh repair and those in group B underwent preaponeurotic mesh repair .
METHODS	Both groups were assessed and compared .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the two groups in the demographics , hernia characteristics , risk factors , type of anesthesia , American Society of Anesthesiologists score or the mean follow-up period .
RESULTS	The length of the operation was significantly shorter in group B than in group A ( P value = 0.01 ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in the early postoperative complications except for the development of a seroma , which developed only in group B ( P value = 0.044 ) .
RESULTS	The postoperative pain was significantly lower in group A than in group B ( P value = 0.01 ) .
RESULTS	The time of return to normal daily activities was significantly shorter in group A than in group B ( P value = 0.001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The preperitoneal mesh placement during the repair of paraumbilical hernias is superior to the preaponeurotic placement , because it is associated with fewer complications , less pain and a shorter time of return to normal daily activities .

BACKGROUND	Subphenotypes have been identified within heterogeneous diseases such as asthma and breast cancer , with important therapeutic implications .
BACKGROUND	We assessed whether subphenotypes exist within acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , another heterogeneous disorder .
METHODS	We used data from two ARDS randomised controlled trials ( ARMA trial and ALVEOLI trial ) , sponsored by the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute .
METHODS	We applied latent class modelling to identify subphenotypes using clinical and biological data .
METHODS	We modelled data from both studies independently .
METHODS	We then tested the association of subphenotypes with clinical outcomes in both cohorts and with the response to positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) in the ALVEOLI cohort .
RESULTS	We analysed data for 1022 patients : 473 in the ARMA cohort and 549 in the ALVEOLI cohort .
RESULTS	Independent latent class models indicated that a two-class ( ie , two subphenotype ) model was the best fit for both cohorts .
RESULTS	In both cohorts , we identified a hyperinflammatory subphenotype ( phenotype 2 ) that was characterised by higher plasma concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers , a higher prevalence of vasopressor use , lower serum bicarbonate concentrations , and a higher prevalence of sepsis than phenotype 1 .
RESULTS	Participants in phenotype 2 had higher mortality and fewer ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days in both cohorts than did those in phenotype 1 ( p < 0007 for all ) .
RESULTS	In the ALVEOLI cohort , the effects of ventilation strategy ( high PEEP vs low PEEP ) on mortality , ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days differed by phenotype ( p = 0049 for mortality , p = 0018 for ventilator-free days , p = 0003 for organ-failure-free days ) .
CONCLUSIONS	We have identified two subphenotypes within ARDS , one of which is categorised by more severe inflammation , shock , and metabolic acidosis and by worse clinical outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Response to treatment in a randomised trial of PEEP strategies differed on the basis of subphenotype .
CONCLUSIONS	Identification of ARDS subphenotypes might be useful in selecting patients for future clinical trials .

BACKGROUND	Influenza is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide .
BACKGROUND	Treatment options are scarce , and new drugs with novel mechanisms of action are needed .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of nitazoxanide , a thiazolide anti-infective , for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza .
METHODS	We did a double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled , phase 2b/3 trial in 74 primary care clinics in the USA between Dec 27 , 2010 , and April 30 , 2011 .
METHODS	We enrolled participants aged 12-65 years with fever , at least one respiratory symptom , and one constitutional symptom of influenza within 48 h of symptom onset .
METHODS	We randomly assigned participants to receive either nitazoxanide 600 mg , nitazoxanide 300 mg , or placebo twice daily for 5 days , ( ratio 1:1:1 ) and followed them up for 28 days .
METHODS	Randomisation lists were computer generated and done in blocks of three .
METHODS	Sponsor , investigators , study monitors , patients , and laboratory personnel were all masked to treatment allocation in the study .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the time from first dose to alleviation of symptoms .
METHODS	The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat for participants with influenza infection confirmed by RT-PCR or culture at baseline .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01227421 .
RESULTS	Of 650 participants screened , 624 ( 96 % ) were enrolled .
RESULTS	Of these , 212 were randomly assigned to receive placebo twice a day , 201 to receive nitazoxanide 300 mg twice a day , and 211 to receive nitazoxanide 600 mg a day .
RESULTS	The median duration of symptoms for participants receiving placebo was 1167 h ( 95 % CI 1081-1221 ) compared with 955 h ( 840-1080 ; p = 00084 ) for those receiving 600 mg nitazoxanide and 1091 h ( 961-1295 , p = 052 ) for those receiving 300 mg nitazoxanide .
RESULTS	Adverse events were similar between the three groups , the most common being headache reported by 24 ( 11 % ) of 212 patients enrolled in placebo group , 12 ( 6 % ) of 201 patients in the low-dose group , and 17 ( 8 % ) of 211 patients in the high-dose group , or diarrhoea , reported by seven ( 3 % ) patients in the placebo group , four ( 2 % ) patients enrolled in the low-dose group , and 17 ( 8 % ) patients in the high-dose group .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily for 5 days was associated with a reduction of the duration of symptoms in participants with acute uncomplicated influenza .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and to assess efficacy of the drug alone or in combination with existing drugs in seriously ill patients and those at risk of influenza complications .

OBJECTIVE	The effects on plaque parameters of sugar free chewing-gums ( CG ) sweetened with either maltitol or xylitol were assessed to better understand the role polyols can play in dental caries prevention .
METHODS	A double-blind , parallel , randomised , controlled study was conducted in China .
METHODS	Subjects ( N = 258 , age = 13 to 15 years-old ) were divided into 4 groups : 2 receiving polyols CG , containing respectively maltitol or xylitol , a group receiving gum base ( placebo ) and a negative control group not receiving any gum .
METHODS	CG were chewed for 30 days .
METHODS	This corresponds to a 10 g consumption of polyol per day .
METHODS	Plaque parameters ( growth , pH , bacteria and insoluble glucans ) were evaluated throughout the experimental period .
RESULTS	All parameters studied were significantly modified with gum base compared to no-gum : plaque pH increased ; plaque growth , bacteria ( S. mutans , S. sobrinus , A. viscosus and Lactobacillus ) and insoluble glucans decreased .
RESULTS	Maltitol and xylitol CG led similarly to a higher plaque pH ( AUC , p0 .05 ) on short ( at baseline after the first CG consumption ) and long term ( after 4 weeks of daily CG consumption ) , with or without saliva stimulation compared to both control and placebo groups .
RESULTS	They led to a decrease in plaque growth ( p = 0.02 ) over the experimental period compared to controls .
RESULTS	Moreover , they significantly reduced the concentration of 4 cariogenic bacteria species ( p0 .05 ) in dental plaque compared to gum base .
CONCLUSIONS	Sugar free CG sweetened with either maltitol or xylitol can similarly reduce plaque acidogenicity compared to gum base through a decrease in oral bacteria presence .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of a gum base placebo allowed to isolate effects on parameters involved in dental caries development specific to maltitol and xylitol , and to show these effects were similar .

BACKGROUND	The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasing worldwide and an effective and safe pharmacological treatment is needed .
BACKGROUND	We investigated whether inhibition of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( 11-HSD1 , also known as HSD11B1 ) by RO5093151 could safely and effectively decrease liver-fat content in patients with this disorder .
METHODS	We did this phase 1b trial at four centres in Germany and Austria .
METHODS	Participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( defined as ( 1 ) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy liver-fat content > 556 % ) , insulin resistance ( homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [ HOMA-IR ] of at least 20 mmol/LmU/L ) , BMI greater than 27 kg/m ( 2 ) , and aged 35-65 years were randomly assigned by interactive voice response system in a 1:1 ratio , stratified for triglyceride concentration ( < 17 mmol/L or 17 mmol/L ) , to oral RO5093151 ( 200 mg twice daily ) or matching placebo for 12 weeks .
METHODS	The main exclusion criteria were other liver diseases , aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase concentrations of more than two and a half times the upper limit of normal , history of diabetes or bariatric surgery , and use of weight lowering drugs .
METHODS	Participants and investigators were masked to assignment throughout the study .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was change in liver-fat content from baseline to week 12 .
METHODS	Efficacy analysis was by modified intention to treat , including all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had a baseline and follow-up measurement of liver-fat content .
METHODS	Safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01277094 .
RESULTS	We did this trial between Jan 13 , 2011 , and March 28 , 2012.41 patients were randomly assigned to RO5093151 and 41 to placebo .
RESULTS	35 patients in the RO5093151 group and 39 in the placebo group were included in the efficacy analysis .
RESULTS	Mean liver-fat content decreased in the RO5093151 group ( from 1675 % [ SD 867 ] to 1428 % [ 889 ] ) , but not in the placebo group ( from 1853 % [ 1000 ] to 1846 % [ 1078 ] , p = 002 for between group difference ) .
RESULTS	26 participants ( 65 % ) in the RO5093151 group had adverse events , compared with 21 ( 53 % ) in the placebo group .
RESULTS	The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders ( 12 patients [ 30 % ] in the RO5093151 group vs seven [ 18 % ] in the placebo group ) , and infections and infestations ( eight [ 20 % ] vs nine [ 23 % ] ) .
RESULTS	Nervous system disorders occurred in significantly more patients in the RO5093151 group than in the placebo group ( nine [ 23 % ] vs two [ 5 % ] ; p = 002 ) ; all other differences in adverse events were non-significant .
RESULTS	One participant ( 3 % ) in the placebo group and three participants ( 8 % ) in the RO5093151 group had serious adverse events .
RESULTS	All serious adverse events were deemed unrelated to study treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Inhibition of 11-HSD1 by RO5093151 was effective and safe in reducing liver-fat content , suggesting that targeting of 11-HSD1 might be a promising approach for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease .

BACKGROUND	Bone marrow mononuclear cell ( BMMC ) transplantation for heart failure has shown inconsistent therapeutic efficacy .
METHODS	We enrolled 104 ischemic heart failure patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG ) .
METHODS	After 4 - to 12-week pharmacotherapy optimization , 39 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) of 45 % received injections of BMMC or vehicle intra-operatively into the myocardial infarction border area in a randomized , double-blind manner .
RESULTS	The median number of cells injected was 8.4 10 ( 8 ) ( interquartile range [ IQR ] : 5.2 10 ( 8 ) to 13.5 10 ( 8 ) ) .
RESULTS	We measured LV function and myocardial scar size by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , and viability by positron emission tomography ( PET ) and single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) , pre-operatively and after 1-year follow-up .
RESULTS	LVEF , the pre-defined primary end-point measure , improved by a median of 5.6 % in the control group ( IQR 0.2 to 10.1 ) and by 4.8 % in the BMMC group ( IQR -0.5 to 8.2 ) ( p = 0.59 ) .
RESULTS	Wall thickening in injected segments rose by a median of 4.5 % among controls ( IQR -18.1 to 23.9 ) and by 5.5 % in the BMMC group ( IQR -6.6 to 26.5 ) ( p = 0.68 ) .
RESULTS	Changes in viability by PET and SPECT did not differ between groups .
RESULTS	Myocardial scar size by MRI in injected segments rose by a median of 5.1 % among controls ( IQR -3.3 to 10.8 ) , but fell by 13.1 % in the BMMC group ( IQR -21.4 to -6.5 ) ( p = 0.0002 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	BMMC therapy combined with CABG failed to improve LV systolic function , or viability , despite reducing myocardial scar size .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effects of different dosing intervals on multiple-dose pharmacokinetics , and safety and tolerability of fentanyl pectin nasal spray ( FPNS ) .
METHODS	This was an open-label study in healthy volunteers .
METHODS	Five FPNS treatments ( 1 100 g ; 2 100 g at 4 - , 2 - , and 1-hour intervals , and 8 100 g consecutively ) were administered to the right nostril , with a 3-day washout period .
METHODS	Blood samples were collected at predose and up to 1,440 minutes postdose .
METHODS	Plasma fentanyl concentrations were determined .
METHODS	Pharmacokinetic parameters-peak concentration ( C ( max ) ) , time to C ( max ) ( t ( max ) ) , and area under the concentration-time curve ( AUC ) - were derived using noncompartmental method .
METHODS	For the two-dose regimens , pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between doses using a paired t-test with p < 0.05 as statistically significant .
RESULTS	Thirteen subjects were enrolled and 10 completed the study .
RESULTS	Median tmax was 10-15 minutes across five regimens .
RESULTS	Cmax post the second dose significantly increased for 1-hour ( p < 0.0001 ) and 2-hour ( p < 0.001 ) but not 4-hour intervals ( p = 0.462 ) .
RESULTS	C ( max ) and AUC ( 0-24 ) following 8 100 g were approximately fivefold of those following 1 100 g. Dizziness ( 11.9 percent ) and somnolence ( 4.9 percent ) were most common adverse events ( AEs ) .
RESULTS	12.9 percent of patients discontinued due to AEs .
CONCLUSIONS	FPNS exhibited consistently rapid t ( max ) .
CONCLUSIONS	When intervals between two doses were shorter , the difference in C ( max ) between the first and second dose was larger .
CONCLUSIONS	All regimens of FPNS were well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	Exposure reached a plateau after eight consecutive doses , suggesting potential limited absorption through the nasal mucosa .

BACKGROUND	Transcranial random noise stimulation ( tRNS ) is an innovative technique of non-invasive electrical stimulation .
BACKGROUND	tRNS over the parietal cortex has improved cognitive function in healthy controls and , applied to the auditory cortex , tRNS has shown beneficial effects on tinnitus .
OBJECTIVE	Here we aimed to investigate the effects of tRNS over the auditory cortex on resting state and evoked activity in healthy subjects .
METHODS	We used EEG to measure tRNS induced changes in resting state activity and in auditory steady state responses ( ASSRs ) .
METHODS	Stimuli were 1000 Hz carrier frequency tones , amplitude modulated at 20 Hz and 40 Hz and applied in randomized order .
METHODS	Fourteen subjects participated in a placebo-controlled randomized design study ; each received 20 min of tRNS applied over auditory cortices with 2 mA , with a one week interval between real and sham stimulation .
RESULTS	We found a significant increase in the ASSR in response to 40 Hz frequency modulated tone and a non-significant trend toward an increase in mean theta band power and variability of the theta band power for the resting state data .
CONCLUSIONS	Our finding of tRNS induced increased excitability in the auditory cortex parallels previous findings of tRNS effects on motor cortex excitability and is in line with current concepts of tRNS mechanisms such as increase of stochastic resonance .

###24509273
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was assess the effect of evolocumab ( AMG 145 ) on lipoprotein ( Lp ) ( a ) from a pooled analysis of 4 phase II trials .
BACKGROUND	Lp ( a ) , a low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) particle linked to the plasminogen-like glycoprotein apolipoprotein ( a ) , shows a consistent and independent positive association with cardiovascular disease risk in epidemiological studies .
BACKGROUND	Current therapeutic options to reduce Lp ( a ) are limited .
METHODS	A pooled analysis of data from 1,359 patients in 4 phase II trials assessed the effects of evolocumab , a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9 , on Lp ( a ) , the relationship between Lp ( a ) and lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and apolipoprotein B , and the influence of background statin therapy .
METHODS	Lp ( a ) was measured using a standardized isoform-independent method .
RESULTS	Evolocumab treatment for 12 weeks resulted in significant ( p < 0.001 ) mean ( 95 % confidence interval ) dose-related reductions in Lp ( a ) compared to control : 29.5 % ( 23.3 % to 35.7 % ) and 24.5 % ( 20.4 % to 28.7 % ) with 140 mg and 420 mg , dosed every 2 and 4 weeks , respectively , with no plateau of effect .
RESULTS	Lp ( a ) reductions were significantly correlated with percentages of reductions in LDL-C ( Spearman correlation coefficient , 0.5134 ; p < 0.001 ) and apolipoprotein B ( Spearman correlation coefficient , 0.5203 ; p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	Mean percentage reductions did not differ based on age or sex but the trend was greater in those patients taking statins .
CONCLUSIONS	Inhibition of PCSK9 with evolocumab resulted in significant dose-related reductions in Lp ( a ) .
CONCLUSIONS	While the mean percentage of reduction was significantly greater in those patients with baseline Lp ( a ) of 125 nmol/l , the absolute reduction was substantially larger in those with levels > 125 nmol/l .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to assess whether the combination of low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) and venlafaxine ( 150-225 mg/day ) is effective and safe for treatment-resistant unipolar depression ( TRD ) .
METHODS	In a multicenter ( 18 centers ) randomized double blind controlled trial with three arms , 170 patients were allocated to receive active rTMS combined with active venlafaxine ( n = 55 ) , active rTMS combined with placebo venlafaxine ( n = 60 ) or sham rTMS combined with active venlafaxine ( n = 55 ) .
METHODS	The patients received once daily sessions of active or sham 1 Hz rTMS applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( 360 pulses/day delivered at 120 % of the resting motor threshold ) for two to six weeks ; rTMS was combined with active or sham venlafaxine ( mean dose : 179.0 36.6 mg/day ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the number of patients who achieved remission , which was defined as an HDRS17 score < 8 .
RESULTS	We reported a similar significant antidepressant effect in the 3 groups ( P < 10 ( -6 ) ) , with a comparable delay of action and a comparable number of remitters at the endpoint ( 28 % in the combination group , 41 % in the rTMS group and 43 % in the venlafaxine group ; P = 0.59 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Low frequency rTMS appears to be as effective as venlafaxine and as effective as the combination of both treatments for TRD .
CONCLUSIONS	Because of its short session duration ( the duration of one session was 8.5 min ) and its safety , slow rTMS might be a useful alternative treatment for patients with TRD .

BACKGROUND	Several clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) , with or without emtricitabine ( FTC ) , as pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) for reducing the risk of HIV acquisition .
BACKGROUND	Adherence to the study product was insufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of FTC/TDF in 2 PrEP clinical trials conducted among women ( FEM-PrEP and the Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic study ) , but further analyses of adherence in these studies may inform PrEP demonstration projects and future HIV prevention clinical trials .
METHODS	We randomly selected a subcohort of 150 participants randomized to FTC/TDF in 3 FEM-PrEP sites ( Bondo , Kenya ; Bloemfontein , South Africa ; and Pretoria , South Africa ) to examine adherence levels over time and to assess factors associated with adherence , based on plasma tenofovir and intracellular tenofovir diphosphate drug concentrations in specimens collected at 4-week visit intervals .
RESULTS	We observed drug concentrations consistent with good adherence in 28.5 % of all visit intervals when drug was available to use , but only 12 % of participants achieved good adherence throughout their study participation .
RESULTS	In multivariate analysis , the Bloemfontein site [ odds ratio ( OR ) : 2.43 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.32 to 4.48 ] and liking the pill color ( OR : 2.93 ; 95 % CI : 1.18 to 7.27 ) were positively associated with good adherence , whereas using oral contraceptive pills at enrollment was negatively associated with good adherence ( OR : 0.37 ; 95 % CI : 0.18 to 0.74 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Most participants did not regularly adhere to the study product throughout their trial participation , although a small minority did .
CONCLUSIONS	Few factors associated with good adherence to the study product were identified in FEM-PrEP .

METHODS	Randomized crossover laboratory study .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the effects of ankle destabilization devices on surface electromyography ( sEMG ) measures of selected lower extremity muscles during functional exercises in participants with chronic ankle instability .
BACKGROUND	Ankle destabilization devices are rehabilitation tools that can be worn as a boot or sandal to increase lower extremity muscle activation during walking in healthy individuals .
BACKGROUND	However , they have not been tested in a population with pathology .
METHODS	Fifteen adults with chronic ankle instability participated .
METHODS	Surface electromyography electrodes were located over the anterior tibialis , fibularis longus , lateral gastrocnemius , rectus femoris , biceps femoris , and gluteus medius .
METHODS	The activity level of these muscles was recorded in a single testing session during unipedal stance with eyes closed , the Star Excursion Balance Test , lateral hops , and treadmill walking .
METHODS	Each task was performed under 3 conditions : shod , ankle destabilization boot , and ankle destabilization sandal .
METHODS	Surface electromyography signal amplitudes were measured for each muscle during each exercise for all 3 conditions .
RESULTS	Participants demonstrated a significant increase , with moderate to large effect sizes , in sEMG signal amplitude of the fibularis longus in the ankle destabilization boot and ankle destabilization sandal conditions during the unipedal eyes-closed balance test , the Star Excursion Balance Test in the anterior and posteromedial directions , lateral hops , and walking , when compared to the shod condition .
RESULTS	Both devices also resulted in an increase in sEMG signal amplitudes , with large effect sizes of the lateral gastrocnemius , rectus femoris , biceps femoris , and gluteus medius during the unipedal-stance-with-eyes-closed test , compared to the shod condition .
CONCLUSIONS	Wearing ankle destabilization devices caused greater muscle activation during functional exercises in individuals with chronic ankle instability .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on the magnitude of the effect , there were consistent increases in fibularis longus sEMG amplitudes during the unipedal eyes-closed balance test , the Star Excursion Balance Test in the anterior and posteromedial directions , and pre-initial contact and post-initial contact during lateral hops and walking .

BACKGROUND	Oxygen is commonly administered after extubation .
BACKGROUND	Although several devices are available , data about their clinical efficacy are scarce .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the effects of the Venturi mask and the nasal high-flow ( NHF ) therapy on PaO2/FiO2SET ratio after extubation .
OBJECTIVE	Secondary endpoints were to assess effects on patient discomfort , adverse events , and clinical outcomes .
METHODS	Randomized , controlled , open-label trial on 105 patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 300 immediately before extubation .
METHODS	The Venturi mask ( n = 52 ) or NHF ( n = 53 ) were applied for 48 hours postextubation .
RESULTS	PaO2/FiO2SET , patient discomfort caused by the interface and by symptoms of airways dryness ( on a 10-point numerical rating scale ) , interface displacements , oxygen desaturations , need for ventilator support , and reintubation were assessed up to 48 hours after extubation .
RESULTS	From the 24th hour , PaO2/FiO2SET was higher with the NHF ( 287 74 vs. 247 81 at 24 h ; P = 0.03 ) .
RESULTS	Discomfort related both to the interface and to airways dryness was better with NHF ( respectively , 2.6 2.2 vs. 5.1 3.3 at 24 h , P = 0.006 ; 2.2 1.8 vs. 3.7 2.4 at 24 h , P = 0.002 ) .
RESULTS	Fewer patients had interface displacements ( 32 % vs. 56 % ; P = 0.01 ) , oxygen desaturations ( 40 % vs. 75 % ; P < 0.001 ) , required reintubation ( 4 % vs. 21 % ; P = 0.01 ) , or any form of ventilator support ( 7 % vs. 35 % ; P < 0.001 ) in the NHF group .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with the Venturi mask , NHF results in better oxygenation for the same set FiO2 after extubation .
CONCLUSIONS	Use of NHF is associated with better comfort , fewer desaturations and interface displacements , and a lower reintubation rate .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT 01575353 ) .

OBJECTIVE	To determine any differences between the prevalence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in ballet dancers who are girls compared with age-matched nondancers , and to establish if any relations exist between the presence of scoliosis and generalized joint hypermobility , age of menarche , body mass index ( BMI ) , and the number of hours of dance training per week .
METHODS	Cross-sectional , matched pair study .
METHODS	Dance school .
METHODS	Dancers ( n = 30 ) between the ages of 9 and 16 years were recruited from a certified dance school in Western Australia ; each dancer provided a consenting age-matched nondancer ( n = 30 ) .
METHODS	Not applicable .
METHODS	Measurements were taken for angle of trunk rotation using a scoliometer ( presence of scoliosis ) and for height and weight to produce generalized joint hypermobility using Beighton criteria and an age-adjusted BMI , respectively .
METHODS	A subjective questionnaire regarding age of menarche and participation in dance and other sports was completed .
RESULTS	Thirty percent of dancers tested positive for scoliosis compared with 3 % of nondancers .
RESULTS	Odds ratio calculations suggest that dancers were 12.4 times more likely to have scoliosis than nondancers of the same age .
RESULTS	There was a higher rate of hypermobility in the dancer group ( 70 % ) compared with the nondancers ( 3 % ) ; however , there were no statistically significant relations between scoliosis and hypermobility , age of menarche , BMI , or hours of dance per week .
CONCLUSIONS	Adolescent dancers , similar to adult dancers , are at significantly higher risk of developing scoliosis than nondancers of the same age .
CONCLUSIONS	Vigilant screening and improved education of dance teachers and parents of dance students may be beneficial in earlier detection and , consequently , reducing the risk of requiring surgical intervention .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of working length determination methods , electronic apex locator and digital radiography , on postoperative pain .
METHODS	Two hundred twenty patients with asymptomatic single-rooted vital teeth were randomly assigned to 2 groups according to the method used for working length determination , the radiographic group and the electronic apex locator group .
METHODS	After working length determination , chemomechanical preparation was performed in a crown-down technique with ProTaper instruments .
METHODS	A master cone radiograph was taken .
METHODS	Canals were obturated with gutta-percha and sealer by using a lateral compaction technique .
METHODS	Postoperative pain was assessed after 4 , 6 , 12 , 24 , and 48hours by using a 4-point pain intensity scale .
METHODS	In addition , patients were asked to record the number of days necessary to achieve complete pain resolution .
RESULTS	Postoperative pain during the 4-hour to 48-hour interval studied was not significantly different ( P > .05 ) between groups .
RESULTS	The mean times for pain dissipation in the radiographic and electronic apex locator groups were 3.37 2.79 and 3.88 3.34 days , respectively .
RESULTS	The difference between groups was not statistically significant ( P > .05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	There is no difference in postoperative pain between working length measurement methods by using an electronic apex locator or digital radiography .
CONCLUSIONS	The reduced exposure to radiation by using apex locator may be a factor that influences a dentist 's decision to choose the electronic apex locator over radiography .

OBJECTIVE	Rehabilitation has been reported to improve pain and disability for patients after lumbar surgery .
OBJECTIVE	However , studies to investigate the rehabilitation intervention for lumbar decompression surgery during hospitalization are scarce .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to examine outcomes of perioperative rehabilitation intervention for patients who underwent lumbar decompression surgery ( LDS ) .
METHODS	Patients aged 18-65 years old who received their first LDS were randomized into the perioperative rehabilitation group ( PG ) or control group ( CG ) .
METHODS	The PG received rehabilitation intervention during hospitalization for lumbar decompression surgery .
METHODS	Pain , functional capacity , Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RMDQ ) , and Short-Form Health Survey ( SF-12 ) were assessed on admission , at discharge , and at follow-ups one month , three months , and six months after surgery .
METHODS	Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used for statistical analysis .
RESULTS	A total of 60 patients scheduled for decompression surgery for lumbar stenosis were enrolled into the study .
RESULTS	After surgery , the PG showed significant pain relief and improvement of disability as well as quality of life , but there were no significant functional improvements compared with the CG .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings of this study indicate that the rehabilitation intervention during hospitalization improves pain intensity as well as disability and quality of life , yet has limited effects on the functional performance over time up to six months post-surgery in patients who received LDS .
CONCLUSIONS	The study suggest that rehabilitation interventions during hospitalization must include regular support for patient adherence to the intervention program and focus on task-oriented programs for lower extremities such as closed-chain exercises in functional postures .

OBJECTIVE	The 5-HT1B / D agonists ( triptans ) are specific headache medications that have no effect on pain as such .
OBJECTIVE	Although they are routinely used in the treatment of acute migraine attacks , the underlying mechanisms of action are still a matter of debate .
METHODS	Forty-three healthy participants underwent fMRI while receiving trigemino-nociceptive stimulation and control stimuli in a standardized fMRI paradigm .
METHODS	Using a crossover , double-blind , placebo-controlled design , 21 participants ( 10 women , mean age 26.9 , range 20-37 years ) received sumatriptan and 22 participants ( 11 women , mean age 25.5 , range 22-32 years ) received acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) .
METHODS	Administration of medication and saline was randomized between participants of each group resulting in half of the participants receiving saline and the other half receiving the respective medication during the first fMRI data acquisition .
RESULTS	While mean pain intensity ratings did not differ significantly between control and medication nor between medications , we found a significant blood oxygen level-dependent signal increase in the trigeminal nuclei and the thalamus after sumatriptan treatment compared with placebo or ASA .
RESULTS	In addition , we specifically looked for the pharmacologic modulation of functional coupling between trigeminal nuclei and higher brain areas , i.e. , trigemino-cortical pathways , and found a strong coupling during the saline condition , which was altered by sumatriptan but not after ASA administration .
CONCLUSIONS	These data suggest that a specific functional inhibition of trigemino-cortical projections is one of the reasons that triptans , unlike pain killers , act highly specifically on headache and migraine but not pain as such .

OBJECTIVE	To compare dilutional effect of distilled water with saline solution as an irrigation fluid in percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) .
METHODS	Three hundred twenty eight adult patients ( 191 men , 137 women ) who were candidates for PCNL were randomly assigned into two groups ( distilled water , n = 158 , group 1 ; saline solution , n = 162 , group 2 ) .
METHODS	Stone size , operation time , irrigation fluid volume , blood hemoglobin level , urea nitrogen , creatinine , sodium and potassium levels were checked before and at 6 and 12 hours after operation .
RESULTS	The mean age of the patients was 37.8 years , and the mean stone diameter was 31.5 mm .
RESULTS	There was no clinical case of transurethral resection ( TUR ) syndrome .
RESULTS	Serum sodium depletion was significantly more in group 1 than group 2 ( P < .0001 ) .
RESULTS	Group 1 had significant decreased post-operative serum sodium levels ( P < .0003 ) .
RESULTS	Similarly in group 2 , postoperative serum sodium levels were significantly lower than the preoperative concentration ( P < .01 ) , but it was not the same 6 hours after the operation ( P = .23 ) .
RESULTS	Serum sodium concentrations remained within normal limits in all cases , without causing clinical signs and symptoms of hyponatremia .
CONCLUSIONS	We found that distilled water is safe irrigation fluid for PCNL in adults .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , it is more available and cost effective .

###24826396
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether field photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) of actinic keratoses using a novel preparation of 5-aminolevulonic acid ( novel ALA ) results in fewer subsequent invasive skin cancers developing on the face of individuals with previous facial cutaneous malignancy in a prospective randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Intervention patients received two treatments of novel ALA 2 weeks apart .
METHODS	Controls were observed .
METHODS	Patients were followed up with biopsy of any suspicious lesions for 3 years .
RESULTS	The trial was suspended early because of problems with trial governance and the reporting of severe adverse events .
RESULTS	Sixty-four patients who were recruited at that time at one center were monitored .
RESULTS	Their average age was 71 , and 57 % were male .
RESULTS	Patients were randomized to intervention ( n = 34 ) or observation ( n = 29 ) .
RESULTS	Over the subsequent 3 years , 13 intervention patients ( 38 % ) developed 30 new cutaneous malignancies in the field treated , and 11 control patients ( 38 % ) developed 22 new malignancies .
RESULTS	Some intervention patients experienced prolonged adverse events , including permanent scarring .
CONCLUSIONS	Novel ALA made no difference in the likelihood of new malignancies developing .
CONCLUSIONS	The risks without benefit of this novel ALA are troubling .
CONCLUSIONS	Lack of efficacy and safety of novel ALA can not be extrapolated to other PDT products .

BACKGROUND	Nonmedical use of prescription opioids ( NM-POs ) has reached epidemic proportions in the United States .
BACKGROUND	Unintentional overdose deaths involving prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999 .
BACKGROUND	Herein , we examine NM-POs and their associated risk factors among two cohorts of trauma patients with at-risk drinking .
METHODS	This secondary analysis examines NM-PO from two separate randomized trials that delivered brief alcohol interventions to patients in urban Level I trauma centers .
METHODS	In the first study , data were collected from 1,493 injured patients at a single trauma center , and in the second study , data were collected from 596 injured patients at two trauma centers .
METHODS	All participants were considered at-risk drinkers because they were admitted for an alcohol related injury as indicated by a positive blood alcohol concentration and/or self-reported heavy drinking .
RESULTS	In Study 1 , NM-PO nearly doubled from 5.2 % before admission to 9.8 % at 6 months after discharge .
RESULTS	At 12 months after discharge , those who reported NM-PO ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 2.31 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.28-4 .15 ) and drug use ( OR , 2.62 , 95 % CI , 1.70-4 .04 ) before admission had the highest odds for postdischarge NM-PO .
RESULTS	In Study 2 , NM-PO increased from 5.2 % before admission to 6.8 % at 12 months after discharge .
RESULTS	At 12 months after discharge , those who reported NM-PO ( OR , 2.71 ; 95 % CI , 1.10-6 .66 ) or drug use ( OR , 4.05 ; 95 % CI , 2.00-8 .21 ) before admission had the highest odds for postdischarge NM-PO .
CONCLUSIONS	The results suggest that there is an increased risk of postdischarge NM-PO among injured patients with at-risk drinking , particularly among those with a recent history of drug use or NM-PO .
CONCLUSIONS	Cautious , evidence-based opioid prescribing may reduce exposure to prescription opioids in high-risk patients , risk of subsequent misuse , and possible diversion .
METHODS	Prognostic/epidemiologic study , level II .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the efficacy and safety of repeated 12-week courses of 5 or 10 mg daily of ulipristal acetate for intermittent treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids .
METHODS	Double-blind , randomized administration of two 12-week courses of ulipristal acetate .
METHODS	Gynecology centers .
METHODS	A total of 451 patients with symptomatic uterine fibroid ( s ) and heavy bleeding .
METHODS	Two repeated 12-week treatment courses of daily 5 or 10 mg of ulipristal acetate .
METHODS	Amenorrhea , controlled bleeding , fibroid volume , quality of life ( QoL ) , pain .
RESULTS	In the 5 - and 10-mg treatment groups ( 62 % and 73 % of patients , respectively ) achieved amenorrhea during both treatment courses .
RESULTS	Proportions of patients achieving controlled bleeding during two treatment courses were > 80 % .
RESULTS	Menstruation resumed after each treatment course and was diminished compared with baseline .
RESULTS	After the second treatment course , median reductions from baseline in fibroid volume were 54 % and 58 % for the patients receiving 5 and 10 mg of ulipristal acetate , respectively .
RESULTS	Pain and QoL improved in both groups .
RESULTS	Ulipristal acetate was well tolerated with less than 5 % of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	Repeated 12-week courses of daily oral ulipristal acetate ( 5 and 10 mg ) effectively control bleeding and pain , reduce fibroid volume , and restore QoL in patients with symptomatic fibroids .
BACKGROUND	NCT01629563 ( PEARL IV ) .

###25445335
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a very brief structured counseling for tobacco cessation in dentistry clinics .
METHODS	A cluster randomized trial was conducted in Sweden in 2012-2013 .
METHODS	Twenty-seven dentistry clinics in two Swedish counties were randomized to provide either a structured brief advice based on the 5 A 's model or usual care .
METHODS	Participants were 467 patients currently using tobacco daily ( 225 in the intervention group and 242 in usual care ) , of which 97 % were retained at follow-up , six months after enrolment .
METHODS	Study outcomes were : 7-day abstinence ( primary outcome ) ; 3-month sustained abstinence ; 50 % reduction of the amount tobacco used ; quit attempts lasting at least 24h .
RESULTS	Compared to usual care , brief counseling was not associated to statistically significant increase in the proportion abstinent from tobacco use after 6months .
RESULTS	However , there was a statistically significant association with reduction of tobacco consumption ( OR = 2.07 95 % CI 1.28-3 .35 ) .
RESULTS	Changes in the expected direction for all outcomes were more frequent in the intervention than in the usual care group , and larger among exclusive snus users than among smokers .
CONCLUSIONS	Very brief and structured counseling in dentistry may achieve positive behavioral modifications among tobacco users , with significant reduction of tobacco consumption , particularly among smokeless tobacco users .

OBJECTIVE	To study whether high-dose versus usual-dose statin treatment reduces the incidence of peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) and what is the effect of high-dose statin treatment on cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) outcome in patients with PAD .
RESULTS	In the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering trial , 8888 post-myocardial infarction patients were randomised to high-dose or usual-dose statin therapy ( atorvastatin 80mg/day vs simvastatin 20-40mg / day ) .
RESULTS	We investigated the effect of high-dose versus usual-dose statins on the pre-specified outcome PAD incidence , and additionally performed a posthoc analysis of the efficacy of high-dose statins in reducing CVD risk among patients with PAD .
RESULTS	During a median follow-up of 4.8 years , 94 patients ( 2.2 % ) receiving atorvastatin and 135 patients ( 3.2 % ) receiving simvastatin developed PAD ( HR = 0.70 , 95 % CI 0.53 to 0.91 ; p = 0.007 ) .
RESULTS	The risk of major coronary events was almost twofold higher in patients with PAD at baseline , but was no longer significant after adjusting for the adverse cardiovascular risk profile .
RESULTS	In PAD patients , major coronary events occurred in fewer patients in the atorvastatin group ( 14.4 % ) than in the simvastatin group ( 20.1 % ) , but the difference did not reach statistical significance .
RESULTS	( HR = 0.68 , 95 % CI 0.41 to 1.11 ; p = 0.13 ) .
RESULTS	Atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced overall cardiovascular ( p = 0.046 ) and coronary events ( p = 0.004 ) , and coronary revascularisation ( p = 0.007 ) in these patients .
CONCLUSIONS	High-dose statin therapy with atorvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of PAD compared with usual-dose statin therapy with simvastatin .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with a history of PAD at baseline were at higher risk of future coronary events and this risk was reduced by high-dose atorvastatin treatment .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of tube current limitation on contrast enhancement , image quality , and radiation dose in whole-body 64-detector CT with a high heat-capacity X-ray tube and automated tube current modulation .
METHODS	One hundred eighteen patients were randomized into three whole-body CT protocols : tube current limitation at 210 mA , 450 mA , and no limitation .
METHODS	Signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , dose-length product ( DLP ) , estimated effective dose ( ED ) , and image quality were assessed .
RESULTS	Mean SNR of aorta was comparable among protocols , but that of liver was somewhat lower in 210-mA than in 450-mA and no-limitation protocols ( p < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	Mean DLP with 210-mA ( 533.8 mGy cm ) was reduced by 31 % from that with 450-mA ( 768.4 mGy cm ) and by 38 % from that with no-limitation protocol ( 861.3 mGy cm ) , respectively .
RESULTS	Image quality was slightly degraded ( p < 0.017 ) with 210 mA relative to the others in thorax and pelvis , but no difference was found in diagnostic acceptability .
CONCLUSIONS	For whole-body CT using multidetector CT mounted with a high heat-capacity X-ray tube , an appropriate tube current limitation setting may help reduce excessive radiation dose without significant compromise in diagnostic acceptability .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment ( 48 weeks ) with tiotropium bromide ( 5 g ) via Respimat ( ) with placebo in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .
METHODS	A total of 338 patients were randomized in this double-blind , placebo controlled , parallel study .
METHODS	All patients received either tiotropium bromide or placebo .
METHODS	Tiotropium bromide solution 5 g ( 22.5 g/puff ) or matching placebo was delivered via Respimat ( ) at a dosage of once daily for 48 weeks .
METHODS	Co-primary endpoints were trough forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV ( 1 ) ) and the time to first exacerbation .
RESULTS	Statistically significant improvements of both trough FEV ( 1 ) and trough forced vital capacity ( FVC ) in the tiotropium group were achieved at weeks 4 , 24 , and 48 compared with those in the placebo group ( P < 0.000 1 ) .
RESULTS	Tiotropium treatment delayed the time to first exacerbation .
RESULTS	The time was 157 days in the tiotropium group and 85 days in the placebo group .
RESULTS	A statistically significant difference ( P = 0.002 7 ) in favor of tiotropium was also observed .
RESULTS	The total numbers of exacerbation during treatment were 90 and 128 in the tiotropium and placebo groups , respectively .
RESULTS	The Poisson regression analysis gave a mean exacerbation rate per patient year exposure of 0.67 in the tiotropium group compared to 0.98 in the placebo group with a rate ratio of 0.69 ( 95 % CI 0.50-0 .93 , P = 0.016 4 ) .
RESULTS	A much larger improvement from baseline in St. George 's respiratory questionnaire ( SGRQ ) total score was observed for the tiotropium group than in the placebo group ( P = 0.036 7 ) , SGRQ symptom and activity scores of patients in the tiotropium group were also superior to those of patients receiving placebo .
RESULTS	The drugs-related adverse events in the tiotropium and placebo groups were 12 cases and 11 cases , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Tiotropium significantly improved lung function and quality of life , delayed the time to first exacerbation , reduced the number of exacerbation .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , tiotropium was well tolerated .

BACKGROUND	According to the International Association for the Study of Pain ( IASP ) , the term temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) regards a subgroup of orofacial pain , the symptoms of which include pain or discomfort in the temporomandibular joint , ears , masticatory muscles and neck on one or both sides , as well as joint sounds , limited mandibular movements or mandibular deviation and difficulties chewing .
BACKGROUND	Phototherapy , such as low-level laser therapy ( LLLT ) and light-emitting diode ( LED ) therapy , is one of the resources used to treatment muscle pain .
BACKGROUND	Thus , there is a need to investigate therapeutic resources that combine different wavelengths as well as different light sources ( LLLT and LED ) in the same apparatus .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the effects of four different doses of phototherapy on pain , activity of the masticatory muscles ( masseter and bilateral anterior temporal ) and joint mobility in individuals with temporomandibular disorder .
BACKGROUND	A further aim is to determine the cumulative effect 24 and 48 hours after a single session .
METHODS	A placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomized , clinical trial will be carried out involving 72 women between 18 and 40 years of age with a diagnosis of myogenous TMD .
METHODS	The participants will then be randomly allocated to four groups totaling 18 individuals per group .
METHODS	Three groups will be submitted to a single session of phototherapy with different light sources , and one group will receive placebo therapy : Group A ( 2.62 Joules ) ; Group B ( 5.24 Joules ) ; Group C ( 7.86 Joules ) ; and Group D ( 0 Joules ) .
METHODS	The following assessment tools will be administered on four separate occasions ( baseline and immediately after , 24 h after and 48 h after phototherapy ) .
METHODS	Pain intensity will be assessed using the visual analog scale for pain , while pain thresholds will be determined using algometer , and electromyographic ( EMG ) analysis on the masseter and anterior temporal muscles .
CONCLUSIONS	The study will contribute to the practice of the evidence-based use of phototherapy in individuals with a myogenous TMD .
CONCLUSIONS	Data will be published after the study is completed .
BACKGROUND	This study is registered with the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials , NCT02018770 , date of registration : 7 December 2013 .

OBJECTIVE	Data relating to the impact of body mass index ( BMI ) on outcomes after isolated aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) are scarce and controversial .
OBJECTIVE	The study aim was to investigate the predictive value of BMI for early and late mortality after isolated AVR .
METHODS	Data obtained from patients who underwent isolated AVR between January 1998 and December 2010 at the authors ' institution were analyzed retrospectively .
METHODS	Patients were allocated to five groups according to the preoperative BMI : underweight ( BMI < 20 kg/m2 ) ; normal weight ( BMI 20.0-24 .9 kg/m2 ) ; overweight ( BMI 25.0-29 .9 kg/m2 ) ; obese ( BMI 30.0-34 .9 kg/m2 ) ; and morbidly obese ( BMI > 34.9 kg/m2 ) .
METHODS	Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictors of early and late mortality , respectively .
RESULTS	After excluding 20 patients who were lost to follow up , and 30 patients with missing preoperative BMI data , a total of 1,758 patients was included in the analysis .
RESULTS	The mean follow up was 5.6 + / - 3.5 years ( range : 0-13 .4 years ) , and the mean BMI 26.8 + / - 4.3 kg/m2 ( range : 17-52 kg/m2 ) .
RESULTS	Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed no association between early mortality and the BMI groups .
RESULTS	Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed ` underweight ' to be an independent predictor for late mortality ( hazard ratio 2.89 ; 95 % confidence interval 1.63-5 .13 , p < 0.0001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	` Underweight ' is an independent predictor for late mortality after AVR surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	Morbid obesity did not prove to be predictive of a worse late survival .

BACKGROUND	Patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) commonly suffer excessive daytime sleepiness .
BACKGROUND	Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) has limited effectiveness in reducing sleepiness in milder OSA .
BACKGROUND	Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug licensed to treat residual sleepiness in CPAP-treated OSA .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesised that modafinil may effectively treat sleepiness in untreated mild to moderate OSA .
METHODS	Untreated sleepy men with mild to moderate OSA ( age 18-70 , apnoea-hypopnoea index ( AHI ) 5-30 / h , Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) 10 ) were randomised to receive 200 mg modafinil or matching placebo daily for 2 weeks before crossing over to the alternative treatment after a minimum 2-week washout .
METHODS	Mixed model analysis of variance was used to compare the changes on modafinil to placebo while classifying all randomised patients as random factors .
RESULTS	32 patients were randomised ( mean ( SD ) AHI 13 ( 6.4 ) / h , age 47 ( 10.7 ) years , ESS 13.6 ( 3.3 ) , body mass index 28.2 ( 3.6 ) kg/m ( 2 ) ) , 29 of whom ( 91 % ) completed the trial .
RESULTS	The primary outcome ( ESS ) improved more on modafinil than placebo ( 3.6 points , 95 % CI 1.3 to 5.8 , p = 0.003 ) and the secondary outcome ( 40-min driving simulator performance ) also improved more on modafinil than placebo ( steering deviation 4.7 cm , 95 % CI 0.8 to 8.5 , p = 0.018 ) .
RESULTS	Psychomotor Vigilance Task reciprocal reaction time improved significantly over placebo ( 0.15 ( 1/ms ) , 95 % CI 0.03 to 0.27 , p = 0.016 ) .
RESULTS	Improvements on the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire were not significant ( 5.3 points over placebo , 95 % CI -1 to 11.6 , p = 0.093 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Modafinil significantly improved subjective sleepiness in patients with untreated mild to moderate OSA .
CONCLUSIONS	The size of this effect is clinically relevant at 3-4 ESS points of improvement compared with only 1-2 points in CPAP clinical trials .
CONCLUSIONS	Driving simulator performance and reaction time also improved on modafinil .

OBJECTIVE	This study investigated the effects of irrigation solutions , administered at either 21 or 37C in percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) , on hypothermia and related postoperative complications such as late emergence and late recovery from anesthesia , shivering , lactic acidosis , and excess bleeding .
METHODS	Sixty patients who were scheduled for PCNL were enrolled in this prospective randomized double-blind study .
METHODS	Irrigation solutions at room temperature were administered to patients in group R ( 30 patients ) , and warmed irrigation solutions were administered to patients in group W ( 30 patients ) .
METHODS	The two groups were compared for core and peripheral body temperature , incidence of hypothermia , duration of emergence from anesthesia , duration of recovery from anesthesia , shivering , lactic acidosis , and hemoglobin levels .
RESULTS	Hypothermia was incident in 19patients ( 63.3 % ) in group W and in 27 patients ( 90 % ) in group R at the end of surgery .
RESULTS	The difference between the initial and the final core body temperature was 0.90.6 C group W and 1.40.7 C in group R ( p = 0.003 ) .
RESULTS	The extubation time was 4.42.2 min in group W and 5.93 min in group R ( p = 0.032 ) .
RESULTS	Shivering was detected in seven patients ( 23.3 % ) in group W and in 15patients ( 50 % ) in group R ( p = 0.032 ) .
RESULTS	The recovery duration was 49.824.6 min in group W and 67.633.9 min in group R ( p = 0.023 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Administration of irrigation solutions at room temperature in PCNL operations causes the body temperature to decrease significantly , which results in postoperative complications such as late emergence from anesthesia , late recovery from anesthesia , and shivering .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to assess the effect of intraoral aging on the setting status of a resin composite and a glass ionomer adhesive , relative to control specimens stored in water .
METHODS	Metallic brackets were bonded with resin composite orthodontic adhesive ( Transbond XT ; 3M Unitek , Monrovia , Calif ) or a glass ionomer cement ( Fuji I ; GC , Tokyo , Japan ) to recently extracted premolars and kept in water for 6 months .
METHODS	The same materials were also bonded to the premolars of orthodontic patients .
METHODS	After 6 months , the teeth were carefully extracted , with the brackets intact on their buccal surfaces .
METHODS	All teeth were embedded in epoxy resin and sectioned buccolingually .
METHODS	Fourier transform infrared microscopy and Raman microscopy were used for the estimation of the degree of cure in the composite and the salt yield in the glass ionomer adhesives .
RESULTS	The control samples of the composite showed significantly lower degrees of cure than did the retrieved specimens ( 52.40 % 3.21 % vs 57.62 % 1.32 % by Fourier transform infrared microscopy , and 61.40 % 2.61 % vs 67.40 % 3.44 % by Raman microscopy ) .
RESULTS	Raman microscopy significantly overestimated the degree of cure and failed to provide reliable information for the salt yield in the glass ionomer cement .
RESULTS	Fourier transform infrared microscopy showed increased , but no statistically significant difference in , aluminum-carboxylate salts in the retrieved specimens .
CONCLUSIONS	Enhanced oxidation of residual carbon-carbon bonds in the composite and slightly increased dissolution of the weaker calcium-salt phase in the glass ionomer cement were the main differences in the intraorally aged specimens in comparison with the specimens stored in water .

BACKGROUND	Conflicting evidence exists on the efficacy and safety of bivalirudin administered as part of percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) in patients with an acute coronary syndrome .
METHODS	We randomly assigned 7213 patients with an acute coronary syndrome for whom PCI was anticipated to receive either bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin .
METHODS	Patients in the bivalirudin group were subsequently randomly assigned to receive or not to receive a post-PCI bivalirudin infusion .
METHODS	Primary outcomes for the comparison between bivalirudin and heparin were the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events ( a composite of death , myocardial infarction , or stroke ) and net adverse clinical events ( a composite of major bleeding or a major adverse cardiovascular event ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome for the comparison of a post-PCI bivalirudin infusion with no post-PCI infusion was a composite of urgent target-vessel revascularization , definite stent thrombosis , or net adverse clinical events .
RESULTS	The rate of major adverse cardiovascular events was not significantly lower with bivalirudin than with heparin ( 10.3 % and 10.9 % , respectively ; relative risk , 0.94 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.81 to 1.09 ; P = 0.44 ) , nor was the rate of net adverse clinical events ( 11.2 % and 12.4 % , respectively ; relative risk , 0.89 ; 95 % CI , 0.78 to 1.03 ; P = 0.12 ) .
RESULTS	Post-PCI bivalirudin infusion , as compared with no infusion , did not significantly decrease the rate of urgent target-vessel revascularization , definite stent thrombosis , or net adverse clinical events ( 11.0 % and 11.9 % , respectively ; relative risk , 0.91 ; 95 % CI , 0.74 to 1.11 ; P = 0.34 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with an acute coronary syndrome , the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events and net adverse clinical events were not significantly lower with bivalirudin than with unfractionated heparin .
CONCLUSIONS	The rate of the composite of urgent target-vessel revascularization , definite stent thrombosis , or net adverse clinical events was not significantly lower with a post-PCI bivalirudin infusion than with no post-PCI infusion .

BACKGROUND	Afatinib is an oral , irreversible ErbB family blocker that has shown activity in epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) - mutated lung cancer .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that the agent would have greater antitumor activity compared with cetuximab in recurrent or metastatic ( R/M ) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) patients , whose disease has progressed after platinum-containing therapy .
METHODS	An open-label , randomized , phase II trial was conducted in 43 centers ; 124 patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to either afatinib ( 50 mg/day ) or cetuximab ( 250 mg/m ( 2 ) / week ) until disease progression or intolerable adverse events ( AEs ) ( stage I ) , with optional crossover ( stage II ) .
METHODS	The primary end point was tumor shrinkage before crossover assessed by investigator ( IR ) and independent central review ( ICR ) .
RESULTS	A total of 121 patients were treated ( 61 afatinib , 60 cetuximab ) and 68 crossed over to stage II ( 32 and 36 respectively ) .
RESULTS	In stage I , mean tumor shrinkage by IR/ICR was 10.4 % / 16.6 % with afatinib and 5.4 % / 10.1 % with cetuximab ( P = 0.46 / 0.30 ) .
RESULTS	Objective response rate was 16.1 % / 8.1 % with afatinib and 6.5 % / 9.7 % with cetuximab ( IR/ICR ) .
RESULTS	Comparable disease control rates were observed with afatinib ( 50 % ) and cetuximab ( 56.5 % ) by IR ; similar results were seen by ICR .
RESULTS	Most common grade 3 drug-related AEs ( DRAEs ) were rash/acne ( 18 % versus 8.3 % ) , diarrhea ( 14.8 % versus 0 % ) , and stomatitis/mucositis ( 11.5 % versus 0 % ) with afatinib and cetuximab , respectively .
RESULTS	Patients with DRAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were 23 % with afatinib and 5 % with cetuximab .
RESULTS	In stage II , disease control rate ( IR/ICR ) was 38.9 % / 33.3 % with afatinib and 18.8 % / 18.8 % with cetuximab .
CONCLUSIONS	Afatinib showed antitumor activity comparable to cetuximab in R/M HNSCC in this exploratory phase II trial , although more patients on afatinib discontinued treatment due to AEs .
CONCLUSIONS	Sequential EGFR/ErbB treatment with afatinib and cetuximab provided sustained clinical benefit in patients after crossover , suggesting a lack of cross-resistance .

BACKGROUND	Exercise training may improve components of metabolic syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) .
BACKGROUND	The objective of our pilot randomized controlled study was to determine the benefits of a short intensive inpatient individualized exercise training ( IET ) program in sedentary untreated OSAS patients .
METHODS	Twenty-two sedentary patients with moderate to severe OSAS were randomly assigned either to one-month education activity sessions ( n = 11 ; control group ) or to inpatient rehabilitation program ( n = 11 ) , including IET , education activities sessions , and dietary management .
METHODS	Full polysomnography ( PSG ) , OSLER ( Oxford Sleep Resistance test ) , body composition , anthropometric measurements , metabolic syndrome components , and questionnaires were performed at baseline and at study end point .
RESULTS	No changes occurred in the control group in all variables .
RESULTS	Compared to controls , participants randomized to the IET group presented a significant decrease in apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) ( 40.619.4 vs. 28.019.3 ; P < 0.001 ) , oxygen desaturation index ( ODI ) , and arousal index , which occurred in conjunction with significant decrease in body mass index ( BMI ) , neck circumference , fat mass , fasting glucose , and diastolic blood pressure .
RESULTS	Increased sleep latency was found in participants in the IET group with altered values at baseline .
CONCLUSIONS	IET reduced OSAS severity with improvement of metabolic syndrome components with concomitant loss in body fat in sedentary adults .
CONCLUSIONS	If confirmed on a larger scale , a comprehensive rehabilitation program could constitute an additional or alternative treatment for moderate to severe OSAS patients .

BACKGROUND	The most appropriate means of capturing data from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) must be understood to optimize use of this instrument in clinical trials .
BACKGROUND	The utility of the composite score ( frequency times severity ) was recently demonstrated in mild and moderate dementia .
BACKGROUND	Determination of frequency compared to composite scores in mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) warrants investigation .
METHODS	We used the NPI data from a randomized , placebo-controlled , multi-center , 24-week , clinical trial involving 160 patients who were diagnosed with amnestic MCI and had clinically significant neuropsychiatric symptoms ( NPS ) .
METHODS	We calculated standardized changes for both frequency and composite scores .
RESULTS	There were improvements in NPI composite scores in both active drug - and placebo-treated patients , with significant superiority of active drug .
RESULTS	Standardized changes in severity and composite scores tended to be larger than those in the frequency scores , whereas discrimination between treatment groups was similar for all three scores .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings support the hypothesis that in MCI , as in dementia , the NPI frequency score is not more sensitive to treatment-related change than the composite score .
CONCLUSIONS	As the severity score adds information , the use of the composite score has better performance characteristics .

###24423311
BACKGROUND	Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) have clinically relevant disturbances in the effects of the hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to evaluate the importance of the prevailing plasma glucose levels for the effect of GIP on responses of glucagon and insulin and glucose disposal in patients with T2DM .
METHODS	We performed a single center , placebo-controlled , cross-over , experimental study .
METHODS	We studied twelve patients with T2DM ( age : 62 1 years [ mean SEM ] , body mass index : 29 1 kg/m ( 2 ) ; glycosylated hemoglobin A1c : 6.5 0.1 % [ 48 2 mmol/mol ] ) .
METHODS	We infused physiological amounts of GIP ( 2 pmol kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ) or saline .
METHODS	We measured plasma concentrations of glucagon , glucose , insulin , C-peptide , intact GIP , and amounts of glucose needed to maintain glucose clamps .
RESULTS	During fasting glycemia ( plasma glucose 8 mmol/L ) , GIP elicited significant increments in both insulin and glucagon levels , resulting in neutral effects on plasma glucose .
RESULTS	During insulin-induced hypoglycemia ( plasma glucose 3 mmol/L ) , GIP elicited a minor early-phase insulin response and increased glucagon levels during the initial 30 minutes , resulting in less glucose needed to be infused to maintain the clamp ( 29 8 vs 49 12 mg kg ( -1 ) , P < .03 ) .
RESULTS	During hyperglycemia ( 1.5 fasting plasma glucose 12 mmol/L ) , GIP augmented insulin secretion throughout the clamp , with slightly less glucagon suppression compared with saline , resulting in more glucose needed to maintain the clamp during GIP infusions ( 265 21 vs 213 13 mg kg ( -1 ) , P < .001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with T2DM , GIP counteracts insulin-induced hypoglycemia , most likely through a predominant glucagonotropic effect .
CONCLUSIONS	In contrast , during hyperglycemia , GIP increases glucose disposal through a predominant effect on insulin release .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the effect of fall-related concerns on physical , mental , and social function .
METHODS	Community-based prospective cohort study ( secondary analysis using control group data from a randomized controlled trial ) .
METHODS	Two municipalities in the south of the Netherlands .
METHODS	Community-dwelling older adults ( N = 260 ) .
METHODS	Two groups were created using Modified Falls Efficacy Scale scores ( high and low levels of fall-related concerns ) .
METHODS	Five outcome measures representing physical , mental , and social function were included : activities of daily living ( ADLs ) , symptoms of depression , feelings of anxiety , social participation , and social support interactions .
METHODS	Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 2 , 8 , and 14 months .
METHODS	Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance and mixed-effect regression models for longitudinal data , adjusting for age , sex , living status ( alone or with another person ) , educational level , cognitive status , self-perceived health , and falls history at baseline .
RESULTS	At baseline , significantly more limitations in ADLs and social participation were found for older persons with high levels of fall-related concerns than for those with low levels of concern .
RESULTS	These differences persisted over 14 months of follow-up and were consistent over time .
RESULTS	No significant differences were found for symptoms of depression , feelings of anxiety , or social support interactions , except for feelings of anxiety at 14 months .
CONCLUSIONS	Older persons with higher levels of fall-related concerns reported up to 14 months poorer ADL and social participation for up to 14 months than those with lower levels of fall-related concerns .
CONCLUSIONS	From a clinical point of view , the clear relationship between fall-related concerns and ADL dysfunction and social participation may help to target groups who are at risk of developing adverse consequences of concerns about falls .

###25048381
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether an intensive lifestyle intervention ( ILI ) designed to sustain weight loss and improve physical fitness in overweight or obese persons with type 2 diabetes was associated with bone loss after 4 years of follow-up .
METHODS	This randomized controlled trial of intensive weight loss compared an ILI with a diabetes support and education ( DSE ) group among 1,309 overweight or obese subjects .
METHODS	Bone mineral density was assessed at baseline and after 1 year and 4 years of intervention .
RESULTS	ILI was effective in producing significant weight loss ( 5.3 % vs. 1.8 % in ILI and DSE , respectively ; P < 0.01 ) and increased fitness ( 6.4 % vs. -0.8 % ) at year 4 .
RESULTS	In men , ILI participants had a greater rate of bone loss during the first year ( -1.66 % vs. -0.09 % per year in ILI and DSE , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Differences between groups were diminished by one-half after 4 years ( -0.88 % vs. -0.05 % per year in ILI and DSE , respectively ) but remained significant ( P < 0.01 ) .
RESULTS	The difference in rate of hip bone loss between groups over 4 years was related to increased weight loss in ILI .
RESULTS	Among women , the rate of bone loss did not differ between ILI and DSE after 4 years .
CONCLUSIONS	A 4-year weight loss intervention was significantly associated with a modest increase in bone loss at the hip in men but not in women .

BACKGROUND	Epidemiological studies have found a U-shaped relationship between serum phosphorus and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) .
BACKGROUND	The mechanism ( s ) behind such a relationship are poorly understood .
BACKGROUND	Phosphorus ( P ) is reported to improve insulin sensitivity , which is involved in lipid metabolism , and thus we were interested in determining the impact of phosphorus ingestion on postprandial lipemia , a recognized CVD risk factor .
RESULTS	A within-subject study design was conducted , whereby 8 healthy male subjects received a high fat meal ( 330 Kcal ; 69 % energy from fat ; 35 mg of phosphorus ) with placebo or phosphorus ( 500 mg ) in a random order .
RESULTS	Postprandial blood samples ( ~ 10 ml ) were collected every hour for 6 hours after meal ingestion .
RESULTS	Changes in different parameters were analyzed using a 2-factor repeated-measure ANOVA .
RESULTS	In the phosphorus ( P ) supplemented group , postprandial serum P increased ( p = 0.00 ) , while changes in insulin , non-esterified fatty acids ( NEFA ) and triglyceride ( TG ) were not significantly different than that of placebo .
RESULTS	Concurrently , phosphorus supplementation increased postprandial concentrations of apolipoprotein B48 ( ApoB48 ) ( p < 0.05 ) and decreased that of apolipoprotein B100 ( ApoB100 ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Phosphorus supplementation ( 500 mg ) of the meal seems to alter the different components of postprandial lipemia .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings highlight the potential role of phosphorus in CVD .

###24477109
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether extracranial-intracranial ( EC-IC ) bypass can improve cognition over 2 years compared to best medical therapy alone in patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery ( ICA ) occlusion and increased oxygen extraction fraction ( OEF ) on PET .
METHODS	Patients underwent ( 15 ) O PET and were randomized if OEF ratio was > 1.13 on the occluded side .
METHODS	Using blinded baseline and 2-year cognitive assessments , age-adjusted composite z scores were generated from subtests sensitive to right/left hemisphere plus global cognitive functioning .
METHODS	Multiple regression predicted 2-year cognitive change .
RESULTS	Eighty-nine patients were enrolled ; 41 had increased OEF and were randomized .
RESULTS	Two died , 2 were lost to follow-up , and 2 refused 2-year testing .
RESULTS	Of the 35 remaining , 6 had ipsilateral stroke or death , leaving 13 surgical and 16 medical patients .
RESULTS	Controlling for age , education , and depression , there was no difference in 2-year cognitive change between the medical and surgical arms ( 95 % confidence interval -0.5 to 0.5 , p = 0.9 ) .
RESULTS	In post hoc analysis of 26 patients with no stroke in the follow-up period , cognitive improvement was associated with less impaired PET OEF at baseline ( p = 0.045 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Cognitive improvement following bypass surgery was not superior to medical therapy among patients with recently symptomatic carotid occlusion and increased OEF .
CONCLUSIONS	Among those with no recurrent stroke , less hemodynamic impairment at baseline was associated with greater cognitive gain in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Reversing cognitive impairment in hemodynamic failure remains an open challenge .
METHODS	This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion and increased OEF on PET , EC-IC bypass compared to no bypass does not improve cognitive function after 2 years .

###25982590
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the safety , tolerability , and comparative pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of intravenous and oral carbamazepine .
METHODS	In this phase 1 , open-label study , adult patients with epilepsy on a stable oral carbamazepine dosage ( 400-2 ,000 mg/day ) were converted to intravenous carbamazepine ( administered at 70 % of the oral dosage ) .
METHODS	A 28-day outpatient period preceded an up to 10-day inpatient period and a 30-day follow-up period .
METHODS	Intravenous carbamazepine was administered over 15 or 30 min every 6 h on days 1-7 ; some patients in the 15-min group were eligible to receive four 2 - to 5-min ( rapid ) infusions on day 8 .
METHODS	Patients underwent blood sampling to determine the area under the concentration-time curve ( AUC ) for carbamazepine and metabolite carbamazepine-10 ,11 - epoxide following oral ( day 0 ) and intravenous carbamazepine administration ( days 1 , 7 , and 8 ) .
METHODS	Bioequivalence was evaluated in patients with normal renal function ( creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min ) .
METHODS	Safety assessments were conducted through day 38 .
RESULTS	Ninety-eight patients enrolled and 77 completed the PK component .
RESULTS	The mean daily oral and intravenous carbamazepine dosage for 64 PK-evaluable patients with normal renal function was 962.5 and 675.1 mg ( 70 % of oral dosage ) , respectively .
RESULTS	Steady-state minimum concentration ( C ( min ) ) and overall exposure ( AUC0-24 ) for intravenous carbamazepine infused over 30 , 15 , or 2-5 min were similar to oral carbamazepine .
RESULTS	The 90 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) for the ratios of the adjusted means for AUC0-24 , maximum concentration ( Cmax ) , and C ( min ) were within the 80 % -125 % bioequivalence range for 30-min intravenous infusions versus oral administration , but exceeded the upper limit for Cmax for the 15-min and rapid infusions .
RESULTS	All intravenous carbamazepine infusions were well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	Intravenous carbamazepine infusions ( 70 % of oral daily dose ) of 30 - , 15 - , and 2 - to 5-min duration , given every 6 h , maintained patients ' plasma carbamazepine concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	Intravenous carbamazepine 30-min infusions were bioequivalent to oral carbamazepine in patients with normal renal function ; rapid infusions were well-tolerated in this study .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the effectiveness of healthcare team guidance in the implementation of a glycemic control protocol in the non-intensive care unit of a cardiology hospital .
METHODS	This was a randomized clinical trial comparing 9 months of intensive guidance by a healthcare team on a protocol for diabetes care ( Intervention Group , n = 95 ) with 9 months of standard care ( Control Group , n = 87 ) .
METHODS	Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT01154413 .
RESULTS	The mean age of the patients was 61.710 years , and the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 7123 mmol/mol ( 8.72.1 % ) .
RESULTS	The mean capillary glycemia during hospitalization was similar between the groups ( 9.82.9 and 9.12.4 mmol/l for the Intervention Group and Control Group , respectively , p = 0.078 ) .
RESULTS	The number of hypoglycemic episodes ( p = 0.77 ) , hyperglycemic episodes ( 47 vs. 50 in the Intervention Group and Control Group , p = 0.35 , respectively ) , and the length of stay in the hospital were similar between the groups ( p = 0.64 ) .
RESULTS	The amount of regular insulin administered was 0 ( 0-10 ) IU in the Intervention Group and 28 ( 7-56 ) IU in the Control Group ( p < 0.001 ) , and the amount of NPH insulin administered was similar between the groups ( p = 0.16 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	While guidance on a glycemic control protocol given by a healthcare team resulted in a modification of the therapeutic strategy , no changes in glycemic control , frequency of episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia , or hospitalization duration were observed .

BACKGROUND	Dietary carbohydrates may affect metabolic and physiologic parameters .
BACKGROUND	The present study evaluated whether a combination of two dietary fibers , oligofructose ( OFS ) and pectin ( P ) , altered satiety and glycemic parameters .
BACKGROUND	The primary objective of this study was to determine whether dietary supplementation for 3weeks with OFS+P would produce a greater reduction in energy intake of an ad libitum test meal compared to control .
METHODS	This was a single center , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study in overweight and obese , otherwise healthy , subjects ( N = 96 ) .
METHODS	There were two OFS+P treatment groups : high-dose ( 30g/d ) , low-dose ( 15g/d ) , and a control group ( maltodextrin 15g/d ) .
METHODS	Energy intake , appetite measures based on Satiety Labeled Intensity Magnitude ( SLIM ) scale , fasting and post-prandial glucose , and insulin levels and body weight were measured at baseline and at the end of 3weeks .
METHODS	Adverse events and gastrointestinal tolerability of the treatments were also assessed .
RESULTS	An analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) performed on the primary endpoint change from baseline in energy intake , showed no statistically significant difference in energy intake among the three treatment groups ( p = 0.5387 ) .
RESULTS	The LS mean changes ( SE ) in energy intake from baseline to week 3 were -58.3 ( 42.4 ) kilocalories ( kcal ) for the high dose group , -74.2 ( 43.6 ) kcal for the low dose group , and -9.0 ( 42.9 ) kcal for the control group .
RESULTS	For the pairwise comparisons of OFS+P doses and control , confidence intervals were constructed around the difference in LS mean changes .
RESULTS	All study products were generally well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	There was a directional benefit in ad libitum energy intake for both OFS+P doses compared to control , with a greater reduction in kilocalories in the low dose comparison , but the reductions were not significant .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are warranted .

OBJECTIVE	To examine protocol fidelity among teachers involved in a six-month cluster-randomized physical activity ( PA ) intervention .
METHODS	In 2011 , preschools in Springfield , MA were randomized to short bouts of structured PA ( SBS-PA , n = 5 ) or unstructured playtime ( UPA , n = 5 ) .
METHODS	SBS-PA provided structured PA in the classroom during the first 10 min of gross-motor playtime followed by 20 min of unstructured playtime .
METHODS	UPA consisted of 30 min of unstructured playtime .
METHODS	All teachers ( SBS-PA and UPA ) received a written study protocol and 1.5 h of training .
METHODS	SBS-PA also received videos to use to lead structured PA and 1.5 additional hours of training .
METHODS	Study fidelity and process evaluation were assessed twice weekly via semi-structured questionnaire .
RESULTS	Only 56.6 % of SBS-PA and 75.2 % of UPA free playtimes lasted for 30 min ; 86.3 % of SBS-PA teachers implemented structured PA during the first 10 min of gross-motor playtime but only 67.2 % delivered the intervention as instructed .
RESULTS	Only 68.5 % of SBS-PA teachers implemented the 20-minute unstructured playtime .
RESULTS	SBS-PA teachers reported that time limitations was a major barrier in implementing the designed intervention .
RESULTS	Pre-post changes in PA did not differ between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Limited fidelity to intervention protocol likely impacted study findings .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies should focus on strategies to improve adherence among intervention leaders .

OBJECTIVE	Advanced pancreatic cancer ( APC ) , in addition to its high mortality , accounts for the highest rates of venous thromboembolic events ( VTEs ) .
OBJECTIVE	Enoxaparin , a low-molecular weight heparin , is effective in prevention and treatment of VTEs .
OBJECTIVE	Some small studies have indicated that this benefit might extend to patients with cancer .
METHODS	Patients with histologically proven APC were randomly assigned to ambulant first-line chemotherapy and prophylactic use of enoxaparin or chemotherapy alone to investigate the probable reduction in symptomatic VTEs and the impact on survival .
RESULTS	A total of 312 patients were recruited as one of the protocol end points was reached .
RESULTS	Within the first 3 months , the numbers of symptomatic VTEs were as follows : 15 of 152 patients in the observation group and two of 160 patients in the enoxaparin group ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.12 ; 95 % CI , 0.03 to 0.52 ; ( 2 ) P = .001 ) .
RESULTS	The numbers of major bleeding events were as follows : five of 152 patients in the observation arm and seven of 160 patients in the enoxaparin arm ( HR , 1.4 ; 95 % CI , 0.35 to 3.72 ; ( 2 ) P = 1.0 ) .
RESULTS	Overall cumulative incidence rates of symptomatic VTEs were 15.1 % ( observation ) and 6.4 % ( enoxaparin ; HR , 0.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.19 to 0.83 ; P = .01 ) .
RESULTS	Progression-free ( HR , 1.06 ; 95 % CI , 0.84 to 1.32 ; P = .64 ) and overall survival ( HR , 1.01 ; 95 % CI , 0.87 to 1.38 ; P = .44 ) did not differ between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	This study demonstrates the high efficacy and feasibility of primary pharmacologic prevention of symptomatic VTEs in outpatients with APC .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment efficacy was not affected by simultaneous treatment with enoxaparin in this trial setting .

###25022156
BACKGROUND	As spaceflight compromises skeletal muscle oxidative and aerobic work capacity , this study assessed the efficacy of resistance exercise ( RE ) to counteract muscle metabolic perturbations induced by 5 wk unilateral lower limb unloading ( UL ) .
METHODS	There were 21 men and women ( 30-56 yr ) who were randomly assigned to either UL with ( Group , Grp ; UL+RE ; N = 10 ) or without ( Grp UL ; N = 11 ) concurrent RE .
METHODS	Iso-inertial RE comprised four sets of seven maximal coupled concentric-eccentric knee extensions executed 2-3 times per week .
METHODS	Percutaneous biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis before and after either intervention .
METHODS	Levels of mRNA expression of factors regulating skeletal muscle oxidative capacity i.e. , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 ( PGC-1alpha ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , and glycolytic capacity , i.e. , phosphofructokinase ( PFK ) , glycogen phosphorylase and synthase , hexokinase , and phosphorylase kinase alpha1 , were subsequently analyzed .
RESULTS	Grp UL showed decreased ( 36 % ) PGC-1alpha expression , increased ( 1.5-fold ) PFK expression , and a trend toward decreased VEGF post-intervention .
RESULTS	Grp UL+RE showed no changes .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that 5 wk unloading reduces skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and increases glycolytic enzyme activity .
CONCLUSIONS	More importantly , only 12 bouts of high-force , low-volume resistance exercise attenuated these responses .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , the current resistance exercise paradigm emphasizing eccentric overload effectively counteracts unwarranted metabolic alterations induced by 5 wk unloading and may , therefore , aid in maintaining skeletal muscle integrity and endurance , and hence astronaut health and fitness during spaceflight .

###24454970
BACKGROUND	Anti-leishmanial drug regimens that include a single dose AmBisome could be suitable for eastern African patients with symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) but the appropriate single dose is unknown .
METHODS	A multi-centre , open-label , non-inferiority , randomized controlled trial with an adaptive design , was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of a single dose and multiple doses of AmBisome for the treatment of VL in eastern Africa .
METHODS	The primary efficacy endpoint was definitive cure ( DC ) at 6 months .
METHODS	Symptomatic patients with parasitologically-confirmed , non-severe VL , received a single dose of AmBisome 7.5 mg/kg body weight or multiple doses , 7 times 3 mg/kg on days 1-5 , 14 , and 21 .
METHODS	If interim analyses , evaluated 30 days after the start of treatment following 40 or 80 patients , showed the single dose gave significantly poorer parasite clearance than multiple doses at the 5 % significance level , the single dose was increased by 25 mg/kg .
METHODS	In a sub-set of patients , parasite clearance was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase ( qRT ) PCR .
RESULTS	The trial was terminated after the third interim analysis because of low efficacy of both regimens .
RESULTS	Based on the intention-to-treat population , DC was 85 % ( 95 % CI 73-93 % ) , 40 % ( 95 % CI 19-64 % ) , and 58 % ( 95 % CI 41-73 % ) in patients treated with multiple doses ( n = 63 ) , and single doses of 75 ( n = 21 ) or 10 mg/kg ( n = 40 ) , respectively .
RESULTS	qRT-PCR suggested superior parasite clearance with multiple doses as early as day 3 .
RESULTS	Safety data accorded with the drug label .
CONCLUSIONS	The tested AmBisome regimens would not be suitable for VL treatment across eastern Africa .
CONCLUSIONS	An optimal single dose regimen was not identified .

BACKGROUND	It is not clear whether Modic changes ( MC ) is associated with low back pain ( LBP ) outcome .
OBJECTIVE	To study associations between baseline degenerative manifestations and outcome in sick-listed LBP patients .
METHODS	Prospective nested cohort study based on a randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Out of 325 sick-listed LBP patients , 141 were consecutively examined by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and included and 140 completed the study .
METHODS	Degenerative manifestations of the lumbar spine were quantified ; associations were studied in relation to the three primary outcomes : change of back + leg pain , change of function as measured by Roland-Morris questionnaire , and 1-year unsuccessful return to work ( U-RTW ) .
METHODS	By using a previously validated MRI protocol , a specialist in radiology , who had no access to clinical data , described the images .
METHODS	Associations were studied by linear and logistic regression with adjustment for previously identified prognostic factors for 1-year pain and function and for U-RTW .
RESULTS	Clinically , 43 % of the patients had radiculopathy .
RESULTS	Degenerative changes were prevalent with altered disc contours in 84 % , high-intensity zones in 70 % , and nerve root touch or impingement in 63 % of the patients .
RESULTS	MC was identified in 60 % of the patients , 18 % with Type 1 changes and 42 % with Type 2 changes , Type 1 including both Type 1 and Type 1 in combination with Type 2 .
RESULTS	Patients with Type 1 changes reported more back pain and did not improve in pain or disability .
RESULTS	They increased to include 30 % of the patients with U-RTW at 1 year .
RESULTS	Patients with Type 2 changes did not differ significantly from patients without MC but differed significantly from patients with Type 1 changes in all three outcomes .
RESULTS	Other degenerative manifestations were not significantly associated with any of the three outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	The only degenerative manifestation negatively associated with outcome was Type 1 MC that affected 18 % of the cohort at baseline and implied an increased risk for no improvement in pain and function and for U-RTW , even after adjustment for other prognostic factors .

BACKGROUND	Knowledge of the excess hospital costs and prolonged length of stay attributable to perioperative respiratory event ( PRE ) in pediatric anesthesia is useful for hospital planning .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we compared costs ( excess hospital costs and indirect costs ) and length of hospital stay between children who had PRE and did not have PRE for noncardiac surgery at a tertiary care hospital in southern Thailand .
METHODS	A prospective matched cohort study was conducted in children aged < 15 years who underwent general anesthesia between November 2012 and December 2013 at Songklanagarind Hospital .
METHODS	PRE children were matched with no PRE children ( 1:1 ) using a random selection procedure on outpatients/inpatients , type of surgery , surgical charge ( baht ) , ASA physical status , age difference < 9 years , and difference in time of surgery < 6 months .
METHODS	Primary end points were excess hospital costs and number of days hospitalized after surgery .
METHODS	Number of days hospitalized after surgery , excess hospital costs and indirect costs regarding transportation , and income loss of parents between groups were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test .
METHODS	Any hospital stay after surgery between groups was compared using McNemar test .
METHODS	A hurdle model was used to predict any hospital stay and number of days hospitalized after surgery .
METHODS	Multiple mixed-effects linear regression was used to identify predictors of adjusted excess hospital costs and indirect costs .
RESULTS	A total 430 children were included ( 215 matched pairs ) .
RESULTS	More PRE children required hospital stay after surgery ( 81 % vs 72 % , P = 0.004 ) , and PRE children had a longer number of days hospitalized after surgery ( median [ interquartile ranges ] : 1 [ 1-3 .5 ] vs 1 [ 0-2 ] ; P < 0.001 ) and incurred higher excess costs ( P < 0.001 ) but not indirect costs ( P = 0.23 ) .
RESULTS	In multivariate analysis , PRE was a significant predictor for hospital stay after surgery ( odds ratio , 2.56 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.23-5 .31 ) , longer hospitalization ( count ratio , 2.10 [ 1.31-3 .35 ] ) , higher excess costs ( cost ratio , 1.30 [ 1.12-1 .53 ] ) , and indirect cost ( cost ratio , 1.58 [ 1.20-2 .08 ] ) after adjusting for patient and anesthesia characteristics .
RESULTS	Universal coverage ( 74 % ) was associated with 35 % and 64 % higher excess cost compared with the Comptroller General 's Department ( 17 % ) and self-pay ( 7 % ) , respectively ( P = 0.003 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The effects of PRE in pediatric anesthesia were hospital stay after surgery , 2 times longer hospitalization , 30 % higher excess hospital costs , and 58 % higher indirect cost among outpatients .
CONCLUSIONS	Hospital policy to efficiently manage hospital beds and compensatory budget should be developed .

BACKGROUND	The level of evidence regarding the association between red and processed meat intakes and breast cancer risk is still low , due to insufficient prospective studies .
BACKGROUND	Moreover , mechanistic data suggest that some antioxidants may modulate this relationship but epidemiological evidence is lacking .
BACKGROUND	Our objectives were to investigate relationships between red and processed meat intakes and breast cancer risk , and to study whether an antioxidant supplementation modulates these associations , which , to our knowledge , has never been investigated before .
METHODS	The SU.VI.MAX study was a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which participants received a combination of low-dose antioxidants or a placebo from 1994 to 2002 .
METHODS	This observational prospective analysis included 4684 women among whom 190 developed a first incident breast cancer between 1994 and 2007 [ mean ( range ) follow-up = 11.3 ( 0-13 ) years ] .
METHODS	Baseline dietary data were assessed by repeated dietary records in 1994-1995 .
METHODS	Associations between quartiles of red and processed meat intakes and breast cancer risk were characterized by multivariate Cox proportional hazards models .
RESULTS	Breast cancer risk was directly associated with processed meat intake [ hazard ratio ( HR ) Q4vsQ1 = 1.45 ( 0.92-2 .27 ) , Ptrend = 0.03 ] and this association was stronger when excluding cooked ham [ HRQ4vsQ1 = 1.90 ( 1.18-3 .05 ) , Ptrend = 0.005 ] .
RESULTS	In stratified analyses , processed meat intake was directly associated with breast cancer risk in the placebo group only [ HRQ4vsQ1 = 2.46 ( 1.28-4 .72 ) , Ptrend = 0.001 ] , but not in the supplemented group [ HRQ4vsQ1 = 0.86 ( 0.45-1 .63 ) , Ptrend = 0.7 ] .
CONCLUSIONS	Processed meat intake was prospectively associated with increased breast cancer risk .
CONCLUSIONS	This study also suggests that antioxidants may modulate this association by counteracting the potential pro-carcinogenic effects of processed meat on breast cancer .

BACKGROUND	The use of isotonic electrolytic solutions for the intraoperative fluid management in children is largely recognized , but the exact composition still needs to be defined .
OBJECTIVE	The primary objective of this randomized controlled open trial was to compare the changes in chloride plasma concentration using two intraoperative isotonic fluid regimens ( Sterofundin vs. normal saline , both added with 1 % of glucose ) in children undergoing major surgery .
OBJECTIVE	Secondary objectives were to compare changes in other electrolytes , renal function , and the occurrence of hypoglycemia .
METHODS	Children aged between 1 and 36 months , scheduled for major surgery , were randomized to receive Sterofundin or saline during the intraoperative time .
METHODS	Children with preoperative electrolyte abnormalities , hemodynamic instability , and severe renal or hepatic dysfunction were excluded .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the of Cl ( - ) ( = change in plasma concentration between post - and pre-infusion ) , and secondary outcomes included of other electrolytes and intraoperative hypoglycemia .
RESULTS	A total of 240 patients were included in the two study sites and randomized to receive Sterofundin plus 1 % glucose or normal saline plus 1 % glucose , in a open fashion ( 229 were finally analyzed ) .
RESULTS	of Cl - and Mg + + was statistically less relevant in patients who received intraoperative Sterofundin , and of the other electrolytes was comparable between the two study groups .
RESULTS	Relative risk of hyperchloremia was significantly higher when large volumes were infused ( over than 46.7 mlkg ( -1 ) ) , regardless of type of crystalloid infused .
RESULTS	Hypoglycemia occurred in two of 229 patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Sterofundin is safer than normal saline in protecting young children undergoing major surgery against the risk of increasing plasma chlorides and the subsequent metabolic acidosis .

OBJECTIVE	Treatment with azathioprine within 3 months of remission induction with cyclophosphamide is a common treatment strategy for patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis .
OBJECTIVE	This study comprised patients undergoing long-term follow-up who were randomly allocated to azathioprine after 3-6 months or after 12 months of cyclophosphamide treatment .
METHODS	Patients from 39 European centers between 1995 and 1997 with a new diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis that involved the kidneys or another vital organ were eligible .
METHODS	At the time of diagnosis , participants were randomly allocated to convert to azathioprine after 3-6 months ( the azathioprine group ) or after 12 months of cyclophosphamide ( the cyclophosphamide group ) .
METHODS	Patients who did not achieve a remission within 6 months were excluded .
METHODS	This study assessed relapses , ESRD , and death during long-term follow-up .
RESULTS	Patients were allocated to the azathioprine group ( n = 71 ) and the cyclophosphamide group ( n = 73 ) .
RESULTS	Of these patients , 63 ( 43.8 % ) developed a relapse , 35 ( 24.3 % ) developed a renal relapse , 13 ( 9.0 % ) developed ESRD , and 21 ( 14.6 % ) died .
RESULTS	Although there were worse outcomes in the azathioprine group , none were statistically significant .
RESULTS	The subdistribution hazard ratio [ sHR ] for relapse was 1.63 ( 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % CI ] , 0.99 to 2.71 ) , the composite of relapse or death hazard ratio [ HR ] was 1.59 ( 95 % CI , 1.00 to 2.54 ) , the ESRD sHR was 1.71 ( 95 % CI , 0.56 to 5.19 ) , and the death HR was 0.75 ( 95 % CI , 0.32 to 1.79 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	It remains uncertain whether converting to azathioprine after 3-6 months of induction cyclophosphamide therapy is as effective as converting after 12 months .
CONCLUSIONS	Outcomes are still poor for this group of patients and further research is required to determine the optimal timing of maintenance therapy .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine ( CM ) intervention in the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) from liver enzyme ( ALT ) , imaging ( the liver/spleen CT ratio ) and syndrome scores , and to establish standard methods for diagnosis and therapeutic efficacy evaluation with characteristics of CM .
METHODS	A multi-center , stratified randomized , parallel controlled , blindness-method evaluated , superiority trial was performed .
METHODS	Totally 204 patients were randomly allocated into two groups , 102 patients in the experimental group ( treated with CM ) and 102 patients in the control group [ treated with Western medicine ( WM ) ] .
METHODS	The alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , liver/spleen CT ratio , and clinical symptoms were observed in both groups .
RESULTS	Of the randomly allocated 204 cases from 4 hospitals , 3 patients were rejected , and 25 were lost .
RESULTS	Totally 176 cases con - formed to the plan with complete follow-ups .
RESULTS	After 3 months of treatment , syndrome scores and the improvement of partial clinical symptoms ( fatigue and sallow complexion ) were superior in the experimental group to those in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	After 3 months of follow-up , the syndrome scores and improvement of partial clinical symptoms ( fatigue and sallow complexion ) were superior in the experimental group to those in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	There was no statistical difference in improving liver enzymes or the liver/spleen CT ratio between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	There were 4 adverse reactions/adverse events in the two groups in the process of treatment , mainly covering drug-induced liver injury , diarrhea , and epigastric distension .
RESULTS	Adverse reactions had nothing to do with CM treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Jianpi Shugan Recipe had obvious efficacy in treatment of NASH .
CONCLUSIONS	It could remove the liver fat and play a role in anti-inflammation and liver protection .
CONCLUSIONS	It also could improve the indices of liver enzymes and the liver/spleen CT ratio effectively , which was superior to Polyene Phosphatidylcholine Capsule ( PPC ) in improving clinical symptoms , especially for such symptoms as fatigue and sallow complexion .

BACKGROUND	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a chronic inflammatory disease mediated by an array of inflammatory cells and mediators , but above all , CD8 + T-lymphocytes , macrophages and neutrophils are important players in disease pathogenesis .
BACKGROUND	Roflumilast , a first-in-class , potent and selective phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4 ) inhibitor , reduces the rate of exacerbations in patients with a high risk of future exacerbations and has been shown to reduce inflammatory cells and mediators in induced sputum , a surrogate of airway inflammation .
BACKGROUND	However , these anti-inflammatory effects are yet to be confirmed in another robust study directly assessing inflammatory markers in bronchial sub-mucosa .
METHODS	An international , 16-week , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study investigating the effects of roflumilast 500 g once-daily versus placebo on inflammatory parameters in bronchial biopsy tissue specimens , sputum and blood serum .
METHODS	One hundred and fifty patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis for at least 12 months will be recruited into the study and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either roflumilast or placebo .
METHODS	The primary endpoint will be the number of CD8 + cells ( cell counts per mm2 ) in bronchial biopsy tissue specimens ( sub-mucosa ) and the key secondary endpoint will be the number of CD68 + cells ( cell counts per mm2 ) , assessed by indirect immunohistochemistry .
CONCLUSIONS	It is hypothesized that treatment with roflumilast reduces the characteristic inflammation found in the airways of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD , compared with placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	The design of the present study has built on the work of previous bronchial biopsy studies available in the literature .
CONCLUSIONS	It is hoped that it will reveal the cellular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of roflumilast and identify potentially important biomarkers and other surrogate endpoints in patients with COPD .
CONCLUSIONS	The design and rationale for this trial are described herein .

BACKGROUND	Obesity during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes for the offspring and mother .
BACKGROUND	Lifestyle interventions in pregnancy such as antenatal exercise , are proposed to improve both short - and long-term health of mother and child .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesise that regular moderate-intensity exercise during the second half of pregnancy will result in improved maternal and offspring outcomes , including a reduction in birth weight and adiposity in the offspring , which may be protective against obesity in later life .
METHODS	The IMPROVE ( Improving Maternal and Progeny Risks of Obesity Via Exercise ) study is a two-arm parallel randomised controlled clinical trial being conducted in Auckland , New Zealand .
METHODS	Overweight and obese women ( BMI 25kg/m2 ) aged 18-40 years , with a singleton pregnancy of < 20weeks of gestation , from the Auckland region , are eligible for the trial .
METHODS	Exclusion criteria are ongoing smoking or medical contra-indications to antenatal exercise.Participants are randomised with 1:1 allocation ratio to either intervention or control group , using computer-generated randomisation sequences in variable block sizes , stratified on ethnicity and parity , after completion of baseline assessments .
METHODS	The intervention consists of a 16-week structured home-based moderate-intensity exercise programme utilising stationary cycles and heart rate monitors , commencing at 20 weeks of gestation .
METHODS	The control group do not receive any exercise intervention .
METHODS	Both groups undergo regular fetal ultrasonography and receive standard antenatal care .
METHODS	Due to the nature of the intervention , participants are un-blinded to group assignment during the trial.The primary outcome is offspring birth weight .
METHODS	Secondary offspring outcomes include fetal and neonatal body composition and anthropometry , neonatal complications and cord blood metabolic markers .
METHODS	Maternal outcomes include weight gain , pregnancy and delivery complications , aerobic fitness , quality of life , metabolic markers and post-partum body composition .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this trial will provide valuable insights on the effects of antenatal exercise on health outcomes in overweight and obese mothers and their offspring .

OBJECTIVE	This randomized clinical trial assessed the effect of three different prosthetic abutments ( titanium , gold-hue titanium and zirconia ) on peri-implant soft tissue 2 years after treatment in partially edentulous subjects .
METHODS	Baseline data concerning ( 1 ) thickness of the buccal peri-implant soft tissue , ( 2 ) soft tissue thickness above the bone crest , ( 3 ) depth/length of transmucosal pathway , and ( 4 ) periodontal biotype at adjacent teeth were collected .
METHODS	The final sample consisted of 47 subjects ( 21 males , 26 females ) with a total of 97 implants .
METHODS	A two-level ( patient , implant ) statistical model was applied .
RESULTS	At the 2-year clinical observation , recession of the gingival margin was observed only at 13 % of implants irrespective of the type of abutment .
RESULTS	No significant correlation between periodontal biotype at adjacent teeth and peri-implant biotype was observed .
RESULTS	Furthermore , none of the investigated variables at patient level ( age , gender , implant type , periodontal biotype ) or at implant level ( keratinized tissue thickness , probing depth , soft tissue thickness ) was identified as a significant predictor of recession .
RESULTS	In conclusion , this study pointed out that ( 1 ) abutment type was not able to influence peri-implant variables after 2 years , and ( 2 ) caution should be used in considering periodontal biotype at patient level as a possible indicator of the future peri-implant biotype .

BACKGROUND	Transient post-ischemic LV dysfunction due to myocardial stunning in patients with coronary artery disease can be missed by conventional gated SPECT ( GSPECT ) acquisitions .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this IAEA-sponsored multi-center study was to determine whether early post-exercise imaging is more likely to detect stunning than conventional without adversely affecting image quality or perfusion information .
RESULTS	Patients undergoing exercise/rest GSPECT were enrolled in this international multicenter study .
RESULTS	Post-exercise studies were acquired at 15 5 minutes after radiotracer injection ( Stress-1 ) and repeated at 60 15 minutes ( Stress-2 ) .
RESULTS	Rest studies ( R ) were acquired at 60 minutes post injection .
RESULTS	A core laboratory quantitatively assessed perfusion pattern and LV blinded to the acquisition time .
RESULTS	Ischemia was defined as summed stress score ( SDS ) 4 , and stunning was defined as the difference between rest and post-stress LVEF ( - LVEF ) .
RESULTS	In the 229 patients enrolled into the study , both image quality and perfusion information were similar between Stress-1 and Stress-2 .
RESULTS	Post-stress LVEF was associated with both ischemia and time of acquisition , with a significant correlation between SDS and - LVEF , which was stronger at Stress-1 than Stress-2 in the ischemic compared to the non-ischemic population ( r = 0.23 vs 0.08 , P = 0.10 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Early post-exercise imaging is feasible , and can potentially improve the detection of post-ischemic stunning without compromising image quality and perfusion data .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the long-term clinical outcomes of the spot drug-eluting stent ( DES ) implantation strategy , which is used to minimize implanted stent length and the number of stents , versus full lesion coverage for treatment of coronary artery stenoses .
METHODS	We evaluated 1-year clinical outcomes of 1619 patients with stent implantation for a single coronary lesion .
METHODS	They were divided into two groups : those treated by full lesion coverage ( n = 1200 ) and those treated with the spot stenting strategy ( n = 419 ) .
METHODS	The combined occurrence of 1-year target vessel failure ( TVF ) , including cardiac death , target-vessel related myocardial infarction , or ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization was evaluated .
RESULTS	The spot DES implantation group had a shorter stent length ( 23.149.70 mm vs. 25.4413.24 mm , respectively ; p < 0.001 ) and a fewer number of stents ( 1.090.30 vs. 1.160.41 , respectively ; p < 0.001 ) , even though the average lesion length was similar to the full lesion coverage group ( 21.3610.30 mm vs. 20.5810.97 mm , respectively ; p = 0.206 ) .
RESULTS	Spot DES implantation was superior to full DES coverage with respect to 1-year TVF ( 1.4 % vs. 3.3 % , p = 0.044 ) .
RESULTS	Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed that the risk for 1-year TVF was almost 60 % lower among patients who received spot DESs compared to those who received full DES coverage after adjustment for other risk factors ( HR = 0.40 , 95 % confidence interval = 0.17-0 .98 ; p = 0.046 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Minimizing stent length and the number of stents with overlapping by spot DES implantation may result in reduced rates of 1-year TVF , compared with full DES coverage .

OBJECTIVE	To compare pro re nata ( PRN ) and monthly injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab in retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) patients stabilized by monthly injections .
METHODS	Randomized , open-label , vision-examiner masked , 15-month study .
METHODS	Subjects with macular edema secondary to branch or central RVO .
METHODS	Subjects received monthly injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab for 7 months and those meeting stability criteria between months 7 and 14 were randomized ( 1:1 ) to PRN injections versus continued monthly injections .
METHODS	Non-randomized ( NR ) subjects ( never met stability criteria ) received monthly injections .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the slope of change in best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) between months 7 and 15 .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the slope of change in BCVA between months 7 and 15 in patients treated PRN versus those treated with monthly injections ( P = 0.509 ) .
RESULTS	Mean ( standard deviation ) change from baseline BCVA in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letter score at month 15 was 21.0 14.1 in the PRN group ( n = 82 ) versus 18.7 14.1 in the monthly group ( n = 80 ) and 14.5 14.7 in NR subjects ( n = 13 ) .
RESULTS	The percentage of subjects who achieved BCVA 20/40 at month 15 was 76.8 % in the PRN group , 71.3 % in the monthly group , and 46.2 % in NR subjects .
RESULTS	The mean ( standard deviation ) change from baseline central subfield thickness was -247.8 207.5 m in the PRN group , -289.9 177.2 m in the monthly group , and -93.2 225.2 m in NR subjects .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in mean BCVA gains or central subfield thickness reductions at month 15 between the PRN and monthly injection groups ( all > 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	After edema resolution from 7 or more monthly ranibizumab injections in RVO subjects , visual outcomes at month 15 were excellent and not significantly different in subjects treated PRN versus those who continued monthly injections .

###25193534
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether a 3-month contraceptive vaginal ring ( CVR ) delivering ulipristal acetate ( UPA ) can inhibit ovulation in 90 % of cycles .
METHODS	This was a randomized dose-finding parallel group clinical trial .
METHODS	Fifty-five healthy women with normal ovulation at baseline were randomized to receive a low-dose ( 1500 g/day ) or a high-dose ( 2500 g/day ) UPA-CVR for two consecutive 12-week treatment periods , followed by a recovery cycle .
METHODS	A subgroup of women received levonorgestrel ( LNG ) 1.5 mg orally twice ( at the end of both 12-week ring periods ) or once ( at the end of the 24-week treatment ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was ovulation suppression assessed by transvaginal ultrasound and hormone levels .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included endometrial safety and bleeding patterns .
RESULTS	All subjects showed normal ovulation at baseline and recovery .
RESULTS	Ovulation suppression was seen in 81.8 % ( 95 % CI : 73.3 % , 88.5 % ) and 86.1 % ( 95 % CI : 78.1 % , 92 % ) of treatment cycles with low and high-dose , respectively .
RESULTS	Benign progesterone receptor modulator associated endometrial changes ( PAEC ) were seen during treatment ; 78.8 % at week 24 , but resolved at recovery cycle .
RESULTS	A few cases of heavy bleeding occurred near the end of the 24-week treatment , but a single dose of LNG every 12 weeks reduced the increase in endometrial thickness during the second treatment period and prevented excessive bleeding .
CONCLUSIONS	The 3-month UPA-CVR may become an effective long-acting , user-controlled estrogen-free contraceptive .
CONCLUSIONS	The greatest suppression of ovulation was seen with the 2500-g/day ring .
CONCLUSIONS	The 3-month CVR delivering UPA 2500 g/day can become an effective user-controlled estrogen-free contraceptive method .
CONCLUSIONS	Benign PAEC during treatment returns to normal after discontinuation .
CONCLUSIONS	The prevention of occasional excessive withdrawal bleeding , either by a progestin or by using higher UPA levels to increase follicle suppression may permit prolonged treatment .

BACKGROUND	Docetaxel/cisplatin/infusional 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ; DCF ) is a standard chemotherapy regimen for patients with advanced gastric cancer ( GC ) .
BACKGROUND	This phase II study evaluated docetaxel/oxaliplatin ( TE ) , docetaxel/oxaliplatin/5-FU ( TEF ) , and docetaxel/oxaliplatin/capecitabine ( TEX ) in patients with advanced GC .
METHODS	Patients with metastatic or locally recurrent gastric adenocarcinoma ( including carcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction ) were randomly assigned ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) to TE , TEF , or TEX. .
METHODS	Each regimen was tested at two doses before full evaluation at optimized dose levels .
METHODS	The primary end point was progression-free survival ( PFS ) .
METHODS	Overall survival ( OS ) , tumour response , and safety were also assessed .
METHODS	A therapeutic index ( median PFS relative to the incidence of febrile neutropenia ) was calculated for each regimen and compared with DCF ( historical data ) .
RESULTS	Overall , 248 patients were randomly assigned to receive optimized dose treatment .
RESULTS	Median PFS was longer with TEF ( 7.66 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 6.97-9 .40 ] months ) versus TE ( 4.50 [ 3.68-5 .32 ] months ) and TEX ( 5.55 [ 4.30-6 .37 ] months ) .
RESULTS	Median OS was 14.59 ( 95 % CI : 11.70-21 .78 ) months for TEF versus 8.97 ( 7.79-10 .87 ) months for TE and 11.30 ( 8.08-14 .03 ) months for TEX. .
RESULTS	The rate of tumour response ( complete or partial ) was 46.6 % ( 95 % CI 35.9-57 .5 ) for TEF versus 23.1 % ( 14.3-34 .0 ) for TE and 25.6 % ( 16.6-36 .4 ) for TEX. .
RESULTS	The frequency and type of adverse events ( AEs ) were similar across the three arms .
RESULTS	Common grade 3/4 AEs were fatigue ( 21 % ) , sensory neuropathy ( 14 % ) , and diarrhoea ( 13 % ) .
RESULTS	Febrile neutropenia was reported in 2 % ( TEF ) , 14 % ( TE ) , and 9 % ( TEX ) of patients .
RESULTS	The therapeutic index was improved with TEF versus TEX , TE , or DCF .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that TEF is worthy of evaluation as an arm in a phase III trial or as a backbone regimen for new targeted agents in advanced GC .

BACKGROUND	Procollagen 1 amino-terminal propeptide ( P1NP ) is a bone formation marker and has been shown to have a strong association with the extent of bone metastases ( BM ) in patients with advanced prostate cancer .
BACKGROUND	More recently , its levels were found to be affected by androgen deprivation therapies and bisphosphonates .
BACKGROUND	We investigated the role of P1NP as a surrogate marker of sub-radiological skeletal metastases in prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure ( BF ) .
METHODS	BePrepared is a prospective longitudinal substudy of RADAR trial in which serial P1NPs were collected at regular intervals for 123 patients who had completed RADAR protocol treatment .
RESULTS	There was no trend identified in P1NP levels prior to diagnosis of BM .
RESULTS	We found that there was no difference in P1NP concentrations at the time of diagnosis of BM in the group that developed BM compared with P1NP levels in groups with only nodal metastases or BF .
RESULTS	In the group of patients who did not experience BF , P1NP was affected by previous luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone-agonist and bisphosphonate therapy .
RESULTS	Hence , patients who received an 18-month course of androgen deprivation without bisphosphonates had significantly higher P1NP values than patients with shorter androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) course combined with a course of bisphosphonates .
CONCLUSIONS	P1NP is not a sensitive serum marker of early BM in high-risk prostate cancer patients with BF and low prostate-specific antigen levels as its levels are affected by prior history of bone remodelling therapies such as ADT and bisphosphonates .

OBJECTIVE	Postmenopausal bone loss can be exacerbated by environmental contaminants , including the heavy metal cadmium ( Cd ) .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that incorporating phosphorus ( P ) into the diet would lead to the chelation of Cd into P , preventing its absorption and subsequent bone loss .
METHODS	To test this hypothesis , we used ovariectomized rats as a model of postmenopausal osteoporosis to examine the deleterious effects of Cd on bone with and without added P. Fifty 3-month-old ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to five treatment groups ( n = 10 per group ) for 3 months as follows : ( 1 ) control ; ( 2 ) 50 ppm Cd ; ( 3 ) 50 ppm Cd plus 1.2 % P ; ( 4 ) 200 ppm Cd ; and ( 5 ) 200 ppm Cd plus 1.2 % P.
RESULTS	Cd plus P caused a significant loss of whole body ( P = 0.0001 and P < 0.001 ) and femoral ( P = 0.0005 and P < 0.001 ) bone mineral density ( BMD ) and bone mineral content , respectively , and a loss of fourth lumbar vertebra BMD and bone mineral content ( P < 0.0001 and P < 0.001 , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Nonetheless , 200 ppm Cd plus 1.2 % P had the most deleterious effects on whole body and femoral BMD .
RESULTS	For femoral neck microstructural properties , 50 ppm Cd plus 1.2 % P caused an increase in trabecular separation , whereas 200 ppm Cd plus 1.2 % P caused a decrease in bone volume-to-total volume ratio , a decrease in trabecular number , and an increase in trabecular separation and structural model index .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings indicate that Cd exposure , along with high intake of P , may be a public health hazard with respect to bone health .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of integrative medical program based on blood cooling and detoxification recipe ( BCDR ) in treating patients with hepatitis B virus related acute-on-chronic liver failure ( HBV-ACLF ) of heat-toxicity accumulation syndrome ( HTAS ) .
METHODS	Adopting randomized controlled clinical design , a total of 105 HBV-ACLF patients of HTAS were randomly assigned to the trial group ( 64 cases ) and the control group ( 41 cases ) .
METHODS	Patients in the control group were treated with comprehensive Western therapy , while those in the trial group were treated with comprehensive Western therapy plus BCDR .
METHODS	All were treated for 8 weeks and followed up for 40 weeks .
METHODS	Effect and safety of the treatment were assessed , including fatality , liver functions [ total bilirubin ( TBIL ) , albumin ( ALB ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , and aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ] , and prothrombin activity ( PTA ) after treatment and at week 48 of follow-ups .
RESULTS	After 8-week treatment , there was statistical difference in the overall fatality rate ( 15.63 % vs 34.15 % ) , the fatality rate in the mid-term ( 25.0 % vs 64.7 % ) , TBIL at week 8 ( 64.54 + / - 79.75 ) , AST [ at week 2 : ( 178.97 + / - 44.24 ) U/L vs ( 288.48 + / - 58.49 ) U/L ; at week 4 : ( 61.65 + / - 27.36 ) U/L vs ( 171.12 + / - 89.11 ) U/L ] and PTA [ at week 4 : ( 58.30 + / - 15.29 ) vs ( 42.56 + / - 15.27 ) ; at week 6 : ( 60.77 + / - 20.40 ) vs ( 43.08 + / - 12.79 ) ] ( all P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	At week 48 of the followup , the fatality rate of the trial group ( 21.88 % ) decreased by 17.14 % when compared with that of the control group ( 39.02 % ; P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	No obvious adverse event occurred in the two groups during the 8-week treatment period .
CONCLUSIONS	BCDR could significantly reduce the mortality of HBV-ACLF patients .

OBJECTIVE	This study was conducted for the nutritional assessment of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy ( RT ) and to investigate the changes in nutrition status , oral intake , morbidity and quality of life ( QOL ) in cancer patients after intensive nutrition counseling .
METHODS	Eighty-seven cancer patients were randomized to either a nutrition counseling group ( n = 44 , age 58.02.2 years ) or a control group ( n = 43 , 62.01.8 years ) .
METHODS	Nutrition counseling accompanied RT , and the subjects received at least three sessions of individualized dietary counseling over the duration of RT. .
METHODS	Assessment parameters were nutritional intake ( 24-h recall method ) , nutritional status Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment ( PG-SGA ) , QOL and blood parameters including albumin .
METHODS	All parameters were measured at baseline , at the end of RT , and 1 month after the termination of RT. .
RESULTS	Body weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , and energy and protein intake for the intervention and control groups did not differ significantly between baseline and the end of RT. .
RESULTS	However , at 1 month follow-up , protein intake was significantly decreased in the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	Blood albumin , total protein ( TP ) , total lymphocyte count ( TLC ) were not different between the two groups .
RESULTS	According to PG-SGA stage , at 1 month follow-up , patients in the intervention group showed increased number of patients with stage A status ( well nourished ) .
RESULTS	In addition , insomnia and nausea was significantly improved in the intervention group assessed by QOL .
CONCLUSIONS	We suggest that repetitive and intensive nutritional counseling is necessary to improve QOL and to prevent deterioration of nutritional status in cancer patients receiving RT. .

BACKGROUND	Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that is highly effective in treating Gram-negative infections , but inappropriate use leads to toxicity .
BACKGROUND	In 2010 , the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines ( Antibiotic ) were revised to recommend the use of computerised methods to individualise dosing of gentamicin and optimise therapy , rather than traditional nomogram approaches .
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether gentamicin prescribing was compliant with the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines , version 14 ( 2010 ) in a setting where computerised dose recommendation resources and computerised decision support were available , and to determine why the resources were effective or ineffective in achieving compliance to guidelines .
METHODS	During phase 1 , a retrospective audit of gentamicin prescribing from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 ( n = 826 ) at a 320-bed teaching hospital in Sydney was undertaken .
METHODS	In phase 2 , 12 doctors from specialties with high-volume prescribing of gentamicin were interviewed .
RESULTS	Intravenous gentamicin was used in 545 cases , 81 % of which were for short-term therapy ( 48h ) .
RESULTS	Doctors feared inducing toxicity in patients , but limited the dose rather than altering the dosing interval according to renal function .
RESULTS	Of the ` continued ' dosing cases , 55 % went unmonitored and the computerised dose recommendation service was rarely used .
RESULTS	Doctors were unaware of its availability despite electronic alerts accompanying prescriptions of gentamicin .
CONCLUSIONS	In comparison with the national guidelines , there was significant under-dosing and monitoring practices were haphazard .
CONCLUSIONS	Computerised electronic alerts were ineffective in informing users .
CONCLUSIONS	To improve prescribing practices , we recommend exploring alternative computerised decision support approaches ( e.g. pre-written orders ) and more pervasive and persuasive implementation strategies .

BACKGROUND	The construction of a colostomy is a common procedure , but the evidence for the different parts of the construction of the colostomy is lacking .
BACKGROUND	Parastomal hernia is a common complication of colostomy formation .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study is to standardise the colostomy formation and to compare three types of colostomy formation ( one including a mesh ) regarding the development of parastomal hernia .
METHODS	Stoma-Const is a Scandinavian randomised trial comparing three types of colostomy formation .
METHODS	The primary endpoint is parastomal herniation as shown by clinical examination or CT scan within one year .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints are re-admission rate , postoperative complications ( classified according to Clavien-Dindo ) , stoma-related complications ( registered in the case record form at stoma care nurse follow-up ) , total length of hospital stay during 12months , health-related quality of life and health economic analysis as well as re-operation rate and mortality within 30days and 12months of primary surgery .
METHODS	Follow-up is scheduled at 4-6 weeks , and 6 and 12months .
METHODS	Inclusion is set at 240 patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Parastomal hernia is a common complication after colostomy formation .
CONCLUSIONS	Several studies have been performed with the aim to reduce the rate of this complication .
CONCLUSIONS	However , none are fully conclusive and data on quality of life and health economy are lacking .
CONCLUSIONS	The aim of this study is to develop new standardised techniques for colostomy formation and evaluate this with patient reported outcomes as well as clinical and radiological assessment .

BACKGROUND	Zonisamide has been associated with weight loss in children and adults .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the effects of adjunctive zonisamide on weight and body mass index ( BMI ) in children with partial epilepsy .
METHODS	A subanalysis was conducted of a Phase III trial and extension study , in which children with partial epilepsy received adjunctive zonisamide ( target dose 8 mg/kg/day ; maximum 500 mg/day ) .
METHODS	Changes in weight were correlated with skeletal development and sexual maturation .
RESULTS	Overall , 179 children ( 93 male , 86 female ; age 6-18 years ) received zonisamide ( mean duration 370.6 days ) .
RESULTS	Weight loss 5 % was reported for 64 of 179 ( 35.8 % ) zonisamide-treated children .
RESULTS	Of these , 46.9 % were overweight/obese at study entry , compared with 23.4 % at study end ( P = 0.0007 ) ; 48.4 % had normal weight at study entry , compared with 65.6 % at study end ( P = 0.03 ) .
RESULTS	Three patients were underweight at study entry , and four more became underweight by study end .
RESULTS	No consistent correlations between weight loss and skeletal development or sexual maturation were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	Approximately one-third of children treated with zonisamide experienced 5 % weight loss .
CONCLUSIONS	Weight loss was most apparent in children with high baseline BMI values and did not appear to be associated with any consistent effects on growth and development .

BACKGROUND	A multi-center large scale study is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of domestic peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) solutions .
BACKGROUND	Some researchers believe that 6 L/d is enough for adequate dialysis , but there is no multi-center prospective study on Chinese population to confirm this .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we evaluated the efficacy and safety of domestic PD solution ( Changfu ) and its difference between 6 L and 8 L dosage .
METHODS	Adult PD patients who had taken PD therapy for at least one month were selected and divided into four groups according to two dialysis solution brands and two dialysis dosages , i.e. , 6 L dose with Changfu dialysis solution , 6 L dose with Baxter dialysis solution , 8 L dose with Changfu dialysis solution , and 8 L dose with Baxter dialysis solution .
METHODS	After 48 weeks , the changes of primary and secondary efficacy indices were compared between different types and different dosages .
METHODS	We also analyzed the changes of safety indices .
RESULTS	Changes of Kt/V from baseline to 48 weeks between Changfu and Baxter showed no statistical differences ; so did those of creatinine clearance rate ( Ccr ) .
RESULTS	Normalized protein catabolic rate ( nPCR ) from baseline to 48 weeks between Changfu and Baxter showed no statistical differences ; so did those of net ultrafiltration volume ( nUF ) and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) .
RESULTS	Changes of nPCR from baseline to 48 weeks between 6 L and 8 L showed no statistical differences ; so did those of nUF and eGFR .
RESULTS	The decline of Kt/V from baseline to 48 weeks in 6 L group was more than that in 8 L group .
RESULTS	Change of Ccr was similar .
RESULTS	During the 48-week period , the mean Kt/V was above 1.7 / w , and mean Ccr was above 50 L1 .73 m ( -2 ) w ( -1 ) .
RESULTS	More adverse events were found in Changfu group before Changfu Corporation commenced technology optimization , and the statistical differences disappeared after that .
CONCLUSIONS	The domestic PD solution ( Changfu ) was proven to be as effective as Baxter dialysis solution .
CONCLUSIONS	During 48-week period , a dosage of 6 L/d was enough for these patients to reach adequate PD .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical study promotes technological optimization , further helps to improve the safety indices of the medical products .

OBJECTIVE	To assess and compare efficacy , pain , and the learning curve associated with diagnostic therapeutic hysteroscopy using mechanical tissue removal versus bipolar electrical resection in the management of endometrial polyps in an ambulatory care setting .
METHODS	A randomized controlled clinical trial ( Canadian Task Force classification I ) .
METHODS	Hospital de Igulada , Barcelona , Spain .
METHODS	A total of 133 patients diagnosed with endometrial polyp ( s ) were included and randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 hysteroscopic methods .
METHODS	Criteria assessed were total hysteroscopy time , full polypectomy procedure time , pain experienced by patients , and learning curve of staff in training .
RESULTS	The average time to perform total hysteroscopy using the mechanical tissue removal system ( TRUCLEAR 5.0 System ; Smith & Nephew Inc. , Andover , MD ) was 6 minutes 49 seconds versus 11 minutes 37 seconds required for the bipolar electrosurgery system ( GYNECARE VERSAPOINT ; Ethicon Inc , Somerville , NJ ) ( p < .01 ) .
RESULTS	Results for complete polypectomy time favored the TRUCLEAR System at 3 minutes 7 seconds over the VERSAPOINT System at 8 minutes 25 seconds ( p < .01 ) .
RESULTS	If a successful procedure is predicated on access to cavity , visualization , and complete resection and excision of endometrial polyp , the mechanical TRUCLEAR Tissue Removal System shows a higher success rate than the VERSAPOINT Bipolar Electrosurgery System at 92 % and 77 % , respectively .
RESULTS	Analysis of pain using the visual analog scale revealed no significant differences between the 2 techniques ( p > .05 ) .
RESULTS	A study of the residents ' learning curve showed a higher level of autonomy with hysteroscopy using the TRUCLEAR Tissue Removal System with which residents showed a higher level of confidence compared with hysteroscopy with the VERSAPOINT Bipolar Electrosurgery System .
CONCLUSIONS	In hysteroscopic polypectomy , the mechanical tissue removal system was significantly faster , achieved a greater success rate for complete polypectomy , and required a shorter learning curve from staff being trained in the management of endometrial polyps when compared with bipolar electrical resection .

BACKGROUND	Complicated skin and skin structure infections ( cSSSIs ) are characterized by infections with gram-positive or gram-negative aerobic or anaerobic bacteria , as well as by a polymicrobial etiology .
BACKGROUND	These invading microorganisms are recognized by pattern-recognition receptors ( PRRs ) of the innate immune system .
BACKGROUND	This study assessed whether genetic variation in genes encoding PRRs influences the susceptibility to cSSSIs .
METHODS	A total of 318 patients with cSSSI and 328 healthy controls were genotyped for 9 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in PRR genes coding for Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 ; NOD-like receptor 2 ; and the signaling adaptor molecule TIRAP .
METHODS	Associations between susceptibility to cSSSIs and a SNP were investigated by means of logistic regression models .
METHODS	In an additional cohort of 74 healthy individuals in whom the same SNPs were genotyped , peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were obtained and stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus .
METHODS	Interleukin 6 concentrations were determined in supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the correlation between genotypes and levels of IL-6 secretion .
RESULTS	In the genetic association analysis , polymorphisms in TLR1 ( S248N and R80T ) , TLR2 ( P631H ) , and TLR6 ( P249S ) were associated with an increased susceptibility to cSSSIs .
RESULTS	No association with susceptibility to cSSSIs was observed for polymorphisms TLR2 ( R753Q ) , TLR4 ( D299G and T399I ) , NOD2 ( P268S ) , and TIRAP ( S180L ) .
RESULTS	In the functional analysis , individuals bearing the TLR1 248N or 80T allele showed lower IL-6 secretion upon stimulation with S. aureus .
CONCLUSIONS	Polymorphisms in TLR1 , TLR2 , and TLR6 are associated with increased susceptibility to cSSSIs .
CONCLUSIONS	For TLR1 , impaired proinflammatory cytokine production due to the polymorphism is most likely the mechanism mediating this effect .

OBJECTIVE	Cognitive benefits of multivitamins have been observed in the elderly , but fewer trials have investigated younger , healthy cohorts .
OBJECTIVE	This randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled study investigated the cognitive effects of 16-week multivitamin supplementation in adults aged 20-49years .
METHODS	A total of 138 participants aged 20-50years were randomised and 116 completed the trial .
METHODS	The participants completed a computerised battery of cognitive tasks before and after 16-week supplementation with a multivitamin containing minerals and herbs or placebo .
METHODS	Blood measures of homocysteine , vitamin B6 , B12 and folate were collected at both time points .
RESULTS	In men , there was a strong trend ( p = 0.01 ; which did not reach significance when adjusted for multiple comparisons ) for the multivitamin to improve performance on the incongruent stroop task , a measure of selective attention and response inhibition .
RESULTS	There were no cognitive benefits of multivitamin supplements in women .
RESULTS	Multivitamin supplementation substantially increased blood levels of vitamin B6 , B12 and folate in both genders and decreased homocysteine in men .
RESULTS	In men who received the multivitamin , improved stroop congruent performance was associated with increased vitamin B6 levels .
CONCLUSIONS	Multivitamin supplementation may be useful for maintaining levels of B vitamins .
CONCLUSIONS	The effects of multivitamins on speeded attention such as the stroop task in young adults warrant further investigation .

BACKGROUND	Current cognitive behavioral models of hoarding view hoarding as a multifaceted problem stemming from various information processing deficits .
BACKGROUND	However , there is also reason to suspect that the consequences of hoarding may in turn impact or modulate deficits in information processing .
BACKGROUND	The current study sought to expand upon the existing literature by manipulating clutter to examine whether the presence of a cluttered environment affects information processing .
METHODS	Participants included 34 individuals with hoarding disorder .
METHODS	Participants were randomized into a clutter or non-clutter condition and asked to complete various neuropsychological tasks of memory and attention .
RESULTS	Results revealed that hoarding severity was associated with difficulties in sustained attention .
RESULTS	However , individuals in the clutter condition relative to the non-clutter condition did not experience greater deficits in information processing .
CONCLUSIONS	Limitations include the cross-sectional design and small sample size .
CONCLUSIONS	The current findings add considerably to a growing body of literature on the relationships between information processing deficits and hoarding behaviors .
CONCLUSIONS	Research of this type is integral to understanding the etiology and maintenance of hoarding .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the safety and efficacy of methazolamide as a potential therapy for type 2 diabetes .
METHODS	This double-blind , placebo-controlled study randomized 76 patients to oral methazolamide ( 40 mg b.i.d. ) or placebo for 24 weeks .
METHODS	The primary efficacy end point for methazolamide treatment was a placebo-corrected reduction in HbA1c from baseline after 24 weeks ( HbA1c ) .
RESULTS	Mean SD baseline HbA1c was 7.1 0.7 % ( 54 5 mmol/mol ; n = 37 ) and 7.4 0.6 % ( 57 5 mmol/mol ; n = 39 ) in the methazolamide and placebo groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Methazolamide treatment was associated with a HbA1c of -0.39 % ( 95 % CI -0.82 , 0.04 ; P < 0.05 ) ( -4.3 mmol/mol [ -9.0 , 0.4 ] ) , an increase in the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c 6.5 % ( 48 mmol/mol ) from 8 to 33 % , a rapid reduction in alanine aminotransferase ( 10 units/L ) , and weight loss ( 2 % ) in metformin-cotreated patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Methazolamide is the archetype for a new intervention in type 2 diabetes with clinical benefits beyond glucose control .

OBJECTIVE	Although procedural sedation using intravenous agents is highly effective for forearm fracture reduction , the process is both resource and time intensive .
OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to determine whether the use of a hematoma block as an adjunct to procedural sedation with ketamine and midazolam reduces ( 1 ) pain during the procedure ( scored using the Observational Score for Behavioral Distress-Revised score ) or ( 2 ) the excess sedation time , defined by the time between procedure completion and discharge from sedation .
OBJECTIVE	Our secondary outcome measure was total ketamine dose administered during the procedure .
METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted .
METHODS	Before fracture reduction , children 3 to 17 years of age randomly received 2 % lidocaine ( L ) or normal saline ( NS ) into the hematoma of their fracture site during sedation with intravenous ketamine and midazolam .
RESULTS	Ninety patients were randomized : 50 to L and 40 to NS .
RESULTS	The groups were similar with regard to age , sex , type of fracture , and prior administration of pain medication .
RESULTS	Median Observational Score for Behavioral Distress-Revised scores were 1.11 and 1.69 for the L and NS groups , respectively ( P = 0.23 ) .
RESULTS	Excess sedation time was not significantly different between the groups ( P = 0.36 ) , with a median excess sedation time of 33.0 and 36.0 minutes for the L and NS groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Mean ketamine dose administered was not different between the groups ( P = 0.42 ) .
RESULTS	The mean total dose administered was 1.00 mg/kg and 1.07 mg/kg in the L and NS groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Mean midazolam dose was 0.05 mg/kg for both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of a hematoma block as an adjunct to procedural sedation with ketamine and midazolam for forearm fracture reduction conferred no additional benefit and did not decrease observed pain scores , excess sedation time , or total ketamine dose administered .

OBJECTIVE	This study assessed the safety , tolerability , and pharmacodynamics of emixustat hydrochloride ( ACU-4429 ) , a novel visual cycle modulator , in subjects with geographic atrophy associated with dry age-related macular degeneration .
METHODS	Subjects were randomly assigned to oral emixustat ( 2 , 5 , 7 , or 10 mg once daily ) or placebo ( 3:1 ratio ) for 90 days .
METHODS	Recovery of rod photoreceptor sensitivity after a photobleach was measured by electroretinography .
METHODS	Safety evaluations included analysis of adverse events and ophthalmic examinations .
RESULTS	Seventy-two subjects ( 54 emixustat and 18 placebo ) were evaluated .
RESULTS	Emixustat suppressed rod photoreceptor sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner .
RESULTS	Suppression plateaued by Day 14 and was reversible within 7 days to 14 days after drug cessation .
RESULTS	Most systemic adverse events were not considered treatment related .
RESULTS	Dose-related ocular adverse events ( chromatopsia , 57 % emixustat vs. 17 % placebo and delayed dark adaptation , 48 % emixustat vs. 6 % placebo ) were mild to moderate in severity , and the majority resolved on study or within 7 days to 14 days after study drug cessation .
RESULTS	Reversibility of these adverse events with long-term administration , however , is undetermined .
CONCLUSIONS	In this Phase II study , emixustat produced a dose-dependent reversible effect on rod function that is consistent with the proposed mechanism of action .
CONCLUSIONS	These results support further testing of emixustat for the treatment of geographic atrophy associated with dry age-related macular degeneration .

BACKGROUND	Various surgical meshes are used in the repair of inguinal hernia and are associated with numerous complications .
BACKGROUND	Our main objective in this study was to determine whether a biologic hernia matrix is equivalent to polypropylene mesh in an open inguinal hernia repair using the Lichtenstein technique .
METHODS	A prospective , randomized , double-blinded , single-center trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a biologic Inguinal Hernia Matrix ( IHM ; Cook Medical ) compared with polypropylene ( PP ) mesh using Lichtenstein 's inguinal hernia repair in a 3-year outcomes study .
METHODS	Patients were evaluated for recurrence and complications by a blinded surgeon at 2 weeks , 3 months , 6 months , and 1 year post procedure .
METHODS	Patient demographics , including comorbidities and nutrition status , were recorded .
METHODS	Intraoperative information including hernia type and location , procedure time , level of difficulty , degree of surgeon frustration , and surgical experience were collected .
RESULTS	One hundred male patients provided informed consent and were randomized into the study in a 1:1 fashion .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in degree of difficulty and level of frustration between the 2 groups .
RESULTS	At 1-year follow-up , 3 recurrences were diagnosed in the IHM group as compared with none in the PP group ( p = 0.11 ) .
RESULTS	Persistent pain trended higher in the PP group ( 6 % vs 4 % ) .
RESULTS	All 3 recurrences occurred in the direct inguinal hernia group and were performed by attendings in the first year post training ( 3 different attendings ) .
RESULTS	No recurrences occurred in patients operated on by more senior surgeons .
CONCLUSIONS	The IHM hernioplasty compares favorably with PP mesh at 1-year follow-up with similar recurrence rates and complications .
CONCLUSIONS	Surgeon experience appears to be a major factor affecting successful outcomes .

OBJECTIVE	The authors compared the effectiveness of 50 sessions of schema therapy with clarification-oriented psychotherapy and with treatment as usual among patients with cluster C , paranoid , histrionic , or narcissistic personality disorder .
METHODS	A multicenter randomized controlled trial , with a single-blind parallel design , was conducted between 2006 and 2011 in 12 Dutch mental health institutes .
METHODS	A total of 323 patients with personality disorders were randomly assigned ( schema therapy , N = 147 ; treatment as usual , N = 135 ; clarification-oriented psychotherapy , N = 41 ) .
METHODS	There were two cohorts of schema therapy therapists , with the first trained primarily with lectures and the second primarily with exercises .
METHODS	The primary outcome was recovery from personality disorder 3 years after treatment started ( assessed by blinded interviewers ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were dropout rates and measures of personality disorder traits , depressive and anxiety disorders , general psychological complaints , general and social functioning , self-ideal discrepancy , and quality of life .
RESULTS	A significantly greater proportion of patients recovered in schema therapy compared with treatment as usual and clarification-oriented psychotherapy .
RESULTS	Second-cohort schema therapists had better results than first-cohort therapists .
RESULTS	Clarification-oriented psychotherapy and treatment as usual did not differ .
RESULTS	Findings did not vary with specific personality disorder diagnosis .
RESULTS	Dropout was lower in the schema therapy and clarification-oriented psychotherapy conditions .
RESULTS	All treatments showed improvements on secondary outcomes .
RESULTS	Schema therapy patients had less depressive disorder and higher general and social functioning at follow-up .
RESULTS	While interview-based measures demonstrated significant differences between treatments , differences were not found with self-report measures .
CONCLUSIONS	Schema therapy was superior to treatment as usual on recovery , other interview-based outcomes , and dropout .
CONCLUSIONS	Exercise-based schema therapy training was superior to lecture-based training .

OBJECTIVE	To reduce the incidence of incisional hernia ( IH ) in colorectal surgery by implanting a mesh on the overlay position .
BACKGROUND	The incidence of IH in colorectal surgery may be as high as 40 % .
BACKGROUND	IH causes severe health and cosmetic problems , and its repair increases health care costs .
METHODS	Randomized , controlled , prospective trial .
METHODS	Patients undergoing any colorectal procedure ( both elective and emergency ) through a midline laparotomy were divided into 2 groups .
METHODS	The abdomen was closed with an identical technique in both groups , except for the implantation of an overlay large-pore polypropylene mesh in the study group .
METHODS	Patients were followed up clinically and radiologically for 24 months .
RESULTS	A total of 107 patients were included : 53 in the study group and 54 in the control group .
RESULTS	Both groups were homogeneous , except for a higher incidence of diabetes in the mesh group .
RESULTS	There were 20 emergency procedures in the study group and 17 in the control group .
RESULTS	There were no statistical differences in surgical site infections , seromas , or mortality between the groups ( 33.3 % , 13.8 % , and 3.7 % in the control group and 18.9 % , 13.2 % , and 3.8 % in the study group ) .
RESULTS	No mesh rejection was reported .
RESULTS	The incidence of IH was 17 of 54 ( 31.5 % ) in the control group and 6 of 53 ( 11.3 % ) in the study group ( P = 0.011 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The incidence of IH is high in patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery for colorectal diseases .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of a prophylactic large-pore polypropylene mesh on the overlay position decreases the incidence of IH without adding morbidity .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effect of a Web-based , self-report assessment and educational intervention on symptom distress during cancer therapy .
METHODS	A total of 752 ambulatory adult participants were randomly assigned to symptom/quality-of-life ( SxQOL ) screening at four time points ( control ) versus screening , targeted education , communication coaching , and the opportunity to track/graph SxQOL over time ( intervention ) .
METHODS	A summary of the participant-reported data was delivered to clinicians at each time point in both groups .
METHODS	All participants used the assessment before a new therapeutic regimen , at 3 to 6 weeks and 6 to 8 weeks later , completing the final assessment at the end of therapy .
METHODS	Change in Symptom Distress Scale-15 ( SDS-15 ) score from pretreatment to end of study was compared using analysis of covariance and regression analysis adjusting for selected variables .
RESULTS	We detected a significant difference between study groups in mean SDS-15 score change from baseline to end of study : 1.27 ( standard deviation [ SD ] , 6.7 ) in the control group ( higher distress ) versus -0.04 ( SD , 5.8 ) in the intervention group ( lower distress ) .
RESULTS	SDS-15 score was reduced by an estimated 1.21 ( 95 % CI , 0.23 to 2.20 ; P = .02 ) in the intervention group .
RESULTS	Baseline SDS-15 score ( P < .001 ) and clinical service ( P = .01 ) were predictive .
RESULTS	Multivariable analyses suggested an interaction between age and study group ( P = .06 ) ; in subset analysis , the benefit of intervention was strongest in those age > 50 years ( P = .002 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Web-based self-care support and communication coaching added to SxQOL screening reduced symptom distress in a multicenter sample of participants with various diagnoses during and after active cancer treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Participants age > 50 years , in particular , may have benefited from the intervention .

BACKGROUND	Findings from inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) genome-wide association studies are being translated clinically into prognostic and diagnostic indicators of disease .
BACKGROUND	Yet , patient perception and understanding of these tests and their applicability to providing risk information is unclear .
BACKGROUND	The goal of this study was to determine , using hypothetical scenarios , whether patients with IBD perceive genetic testing to be useful for risk assessment , whether genetic test results impact perceived control , and whether low genetic literacy may be a barrier to patient understanding of these tests .
METHODS	Two hundred fifty seven patients with IBD from the Johns Hopkins gastroenterology clinics were randomized to receive a vignette depicting either a genetic testing scenario or a standard blood testing scenario .
METHODS	Participants were asked questions about the vignette and responses were compared between groups .
RESULTS	Perceptions of test utility for risk assessment were higher among participants responding to the genetic vignette ( P < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in perceptions of control over IBD after hypothetical testing between vignettes ( P = 0.24 ) .
RESULTS	Participant responses were modified by genetic literacy , measured using a scale developed for this study .
RESULTS	Participants randomized to the genetic vignette who scored higher on the genetic literacy scale perceived greater utility of testing for risk assessment ( P = 0.008 ) and more control after testing ( P = 0.02 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with IBD perceive utility in genetic testing for providing information relevant to family members , and this appreciation is promoted by genetic literacy .
CONCLUSIONS	Low genetic literacy among patients poses a potential threat to effective translation of genetic and genomic tests .

OBJECTIVE	Recent epidemiological studies revealed a striking inverse relationship between vitamin D levels , glucose intolerance/insulin resistance ( IR ) , and cardiovascular disease .
OBJECTIVE	However , few interventional studies have evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular risk , such as IR and arterial stiffness , in diabetes .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated the role of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes patients , including metabolic parameters , IR , and arterial stiffness .
METHODS	We enrolled patients who were taking antidiabetic medications or managed their diabetes using lifestyle changes .
METHODS	We excluded patients who were taking vitamin D or calcium supplements .
METHODS	We randomized participants into the vitamin D group ( cholecalciferol 2,000 IU/day + calcium 200 mg/day , n = 40 ) or the placebo group ( calcium 200 mg/day , n = 41 ) .
METHODS	We compared their IR ( homeostasis model of assessment [ HOMA ] - IR ) and arterial stiffness ( brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and radial augmentation index ) before and after 24 weeks of intervention .
RESULTS	The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar .
RESULTS	A total of 62 participants ( placebo , 30 ; vitamin D , 32 ) completed the study protocol .
RESULTS	At the end of the study period , the 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D ] levels were significantly higher in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group ( 35.4 8.5 ng/mL vs. 18.4 7.3 ng/mL , p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	There was no difference in HOMA-IR or changes in arterial stiffness ( placebo , 21 , vitamin D , 24 ) between the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data suggest that high-dose vitamin D supplementation might be effective in terms of elevating 25 ( OH ) D levels .
CONCLUSIONS	However , we identified no beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes , including IR and arterial stiffness .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the efficacy and safety of Curcuma domestica extracts in pain reduction and functional improvement .
METHODS	367 primary knee osteoarthritis patients with a pain score of 5 or higher were randomized to receive ibuprofen 1,200 mg/day or C. domestica extracts 1,500 mg/day for 4 weeks .
METHODS	The main outcomes were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) total , WOMAC pain , WOMAC stiffness , and WOMAC function scores .
METHODS	Adverse events ( AEs ) were also recorded .
RESULTS	185 and 182 patients were randomly assigned into C. domestica extracts and ibuprofen groups , respectively .
RESULTS	The baseline characteristics were no different between groups .
RESULTS	The mean of all WOMAC scores at weeks 0 , 2 , and 4 showed significant improvement when compared with the baseline in both groups .
RESULTS	After using the noninferiority test , the mean difference ( 95 % confidence interval ) of WOMAC total , WOMAC pain , and WOMAC function scores at week 4 adjusted by values at week 0 of C. domestica extracts were noninferior to those for the ibuprofen group ( P = 0.010 , P = 0.018 , and P = 0.010 , respectively ) , except for the WOMAC stiffness subscale , which showed a trend toward significance ( P = 0.060 ) .
RESULTS	The number of patients who developed AEs was no different between groups .
RESULTS	However , the number of events of abdominal pain/discomfort was significantly higher in the ibuprofen group than that in the C. domestica extracts group ( P = 0.046 ) .
RESULTS	Most subjects ( 96 % -97 % ) were satisfied with the treatment , and two-thirds rated themselves as improved in a global assessment .
CONCLUSIONS	C. domestica extracts are as effective as ibuprofen for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis .
CONCLUSIONS	The side effect profile was similar but with fewer gastrointestinal AE reports in the C. domestica extracts group .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effectiveness of a prefabricated appliance and compare it to the effectiveness of a stabilization appliance in patients with temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) pain .
METHODS	This randomized , controlled multicenter study comprised 48 patients diagnosed with TMJ arthralgia according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders .
METHODS	The effectiveness of a prefabricated appliance ( Relax ) , worn by half of the patients ( referred to as the R group ) , was compared to the effectiveness of a stabilization appliance , worn by the other half of patients ( S group ) .
METHODS	Treatment outcome was assessed according to the recommendations by the Initiative on Methods , Measurement , and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials ( IMMPACT ) on an intent-to-treat basis .
METHODS	To analyze the differences between groups , the chi-square test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used , while the Friedman analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) on ranks was used for the analyses between baseline data and follow-up measurements , all with a significance level set at P < .05 .
RESULTS	There were no differences between the groups at baseline .
RESULTS	A 30 % reduction of pain intensity was reported by 62.5 % of the R group and 58.3 % of the S group at the 10-week follow-up ; 58 % and 50.3 % , respectively , at the 6-month follow-up ; and 41.7 % in both groups at 12 months .
RESULTS	At the 12-month follow-up , pain intensity had decreased and physical function had improved in both groups ( P < .005 and P < .016 , respectively ) , without significant group differences .
RESULTS	Emotional function ( depression and nonspecific physical symptoms ) did not change .
RESULTS	Overall improvement of `` better '' to `` symptom-free '' was observed in 67 % of the R group and 58 % of the S group .
RESULTS	No side effects occurred .
CONCLUSIONS	The effectiveness of the prefabricated appliance seems to be similar to that of the stabilization appliance in alleviating TMJ pain .
CONCLUSIONS	Since the prefabricated appliance requires only one visit for construction , it is convenient for both the general practitioner and for the patient .

BACKGROUND	Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) has been associated with increased HIV mortality , but prospective studies assessing treatment outcomes after combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) initiation in resource-limited settings are lacking .
METHODS	A case-cohort study ( N = 411 ) was nested within a randomized cART trial of 1571 cART-naive adults in 8 resource-limited settings and the United States .
METHODS	The primary outcome ( WHO stage 3/4 disease or death within 96 weeks of cART initiation ) was met by 192 cases , and 152 and 29 cases met secondary outcomes of virologic and immunologic failure .
METHODS	We studied prevalence and risk factors for baseline low 25 ( OH ) D ( < 32 ng/mL ) and examined associated outcomes using proportional hazard models .
RESULTS	Low 25 ( OH ) D prevalence was 49 % and ranged from 27 % in Brazil to 78 % in Thailand .
RESULTS	Low 25 ( OH ) D was associated with high body mass index ( BMI ) , winter/spring season , country-race group , and lower viral load .
RESULTS	Baseline low 25 ( OH ) D was associated with increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) progression and death ( adjusted hazard ratio ( aHR ) 2.13 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.09-4 .18 ) and virologic failure ( aHR 2.42 ; 95 % CI , 1.33-4 .41 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Low 25 ( OH ) D is common in diverse HIV-infected populations and is an independent risk factor for clinical and virologic failure .
CONCLUSIONS	Studies examining the potential benefit of vitamin D supplementation among HIV patients initiating cART are warranted .

OBJECTIVE	Domestic violence and abuse ( DVA ) are associated with an increased risk of mental illness , but we know little about the mental health of female DVA survivors seeking support from domestic violence services .
METHODS	Baseline data on 260 women enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a psychological intervention for DVA survivors was analyzed .
METHODS	We report prevalence of and associations between mental health status and severity of abuse at the time of recruitment .
METHODS	We used logistic and normal regression models for binary and continuous outcomes , respectively .
METHODS	Mental health measures used were : Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure ( CORE-OM ) , Patient Health Questionnaire , Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment , and the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale ( PDS ) to measure posttraumatic stress disorder .
METHODS	The Composite Abuse Scale ( CAS ) measured abuse .
RESULTS	Exposure to DVA was high , with a mean CAS score of 56 ( SD 34 ) .
RESULTS	The mean CORE-OM score was 18 ( SD 8 ) with 76 % above the clinical threshold ( 95 % confidence interval : 70-81 % ) .
RESULTS	Depression and anxiety levels were high , with means close to clinical thresholds , and all respondents recorded PTSD scores above the clinical threshold .
RESULTS	Symptoms of mental illness increased stepwise with increasing severity of DVA .
CONCLUSIONS	Exposure to DVA was high , with a mean CAS score of 56 ( SD 34 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The mean CORE-OM score was 18 ( SD 8 ) with 76 % above the clinical threshold ( 95 % confidence interval : 70-81 % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Depression and anxiety levels were high , with means close to clinical thresholds , and all respondents recorded PTSD scores above the clinical threshold .
CONCLUSIONS	Symptoms of mental illness increased stepwise with increasing severity of DVA .

BACKGROUND	Women who have survived breast cancer have hot flushes that are `` significantly more frequent , severe , distressing , and of greater duration '' than in other women .
BACKGROUND	We compared the efficacy and safety of stellate ganglion block and pregabalin for the relief of hot flushes in breast cancer survivors .
METHODS	Forty patients who were breast cancer survivors and were suffering from hot flushes to the degree that they seeked for treatment were included in the study and randomly divided into two groups : group I : ( N = 20 ) stellate ganglion block was done for the patients of this group ; and group II : ( N = 20 ) in this group , the patients received 75mg pregabalin twice daily .
METHODS	In both groups self-completed daily hot flush diaries and monthly symptom questionnaires were obtained at baseline and for the following 3 months .
RESULTS	Our results showed that group I ( stellate ganglion block ) had significant ( P < 0.05 ) decline in the frequency of mild , moderate , very severe , and total hot flushes in comparison with group II ( pregabalin 75mg twice daily ) throughout the 3 months of follow up period .
CONCLUSIONS	The stellate ganglion block had superior efficacy in the management of hot flushes in breast cancer survivors .

BACKGROUND	The treatment of obesity is an increasing global health priority , yet few effective drug treatments are currently available .
BACKGROUND	The discovery of novel anti-obesity therapies could be assisted by the validation of experimental ( translational ) medicine models in healthy volunteers that assess efficacy and safety at an early stage of drug development .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the 5-HT2C receptor agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine ( mCPP ) in an experimental medicine model assessing both appetite and mood .
METHODS	Using a between-subjects , double-blind , placebo-controlled design , 24 male and 24 female participants were randomly assigned to either placebo , 15 - or 30-mg mCPP treatment groups .
METHODS	Lunch was eaten from a Universal Eating Monitor ( UEM ) that measured eating rate , and the participants completed the P1vital Oxford Emotional Test Battery ( ETB ) and a series of appetite and mood ratings .
RESULTS	mCPP reduced appetite and , in women , enhanced measures of satiation .
RESULTS	The drug also enhanced memory for emotional material in the word recall and recognition memory tasks of the ETB .
CONCLUSIONS	The results provide new insight into the effects of mCPP on appetite , satiety and memory in humans .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , our data provide an illustration of the value of measuring changes in appetite and mood in healthy volunteers to determine the potential efficacy and safety of novel anti-obesity drugs .

BACKGROUND	The long-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) in inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis remain unknown .
RESULTS	In the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves ( PARTNER ) study , 358 patients were randomly assigned to TAVR or standard therapy .
RESULTS	We report the 3-year outcomes on these patients , and the pooled outcomes for all randomly assigned inoperable patients ( n = 449 ) in PARTNER , as well , including the randomized portion of the continued access study ( n = 91 ) .
RESULTS	The 3-year mortality rate in the TAVR and standard therapy groups was 54.1 % and 80.9 % , respectively ( P < 0.001 ; hazard ratio , 0.53 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.41-0 .68 ; P < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	In survivors , there was significant improvement in New York Heart Association functional class sustained at 3 years .
RESULTS	The cumulative incidence of strokes at 3-year follow-up was 15.7 % in TAVR patients versus 5.5 % in patients undergoing standard therapy ( hazard ratio , 2.81 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.26-6 .26 ; P = 0.012 ) ; however , the composite of death or strokes was significantly lower after TAVR versus standard therapy ( 57.4 % versus 80.9 % , P < 0.001 ; hazard ratio , 0.60 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.46-0 .77 ; P < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	Echocardiography showed a sustained increase in aortic valve area and decrease in transvalvular gradient after TAVR .
RESULTS	Analysis of the 449 pooled randomly assigned patients ( TAVR , n = 220 ; standard therapy , n = 229 ) demonstrated significant improvement in all-cause mortality and functional status during early and 3-year follow-up .
RESULTS	The results of the pooled cohort were similar to the results obtained from the pivotal PARTNER trial .
CONCLUSIONS	TAVR resulted in better survival and functional status in inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis with durable hemodynamic benefit on long-term follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	However , high residual mortality , even in successfully treated TAVR patients , highlights the need for more strategic patient selection .

BACKGROUND	Subjective clinical improvement does not always go hand-in-hand with right ventricular ( RV ) reverse remodeling after surgery for isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation ( TR ) .
BACKGROUND	This study aimed to evaluate the level of agreement between clinical improvement and echocardiographic RV reverse remodeling , and determine the relative prognostic powers of these 2 factors in terms of long-term prognosis for patients with isolated TR surgery .
RESULTS	Sixty-one consecutive patients ( 588 years ) were included .
RESULTS	During a median follow up of 55 months ( IQR , 36.571.5 months ) , a composite endpoint including death and admission for right heart failure was investigated .
RESULTS	Extents of reductions in RV end-systolic area ( RV-ESA ) and subjective clinical improvement at 6 months were examined .
RESULTS	There were 6 deaths and 5 admissions for right heart failure .
RESULTS	A reduction in RV-ESA of > 20 % effectively predicted event-free survival , with a sensitivity of 90.9 % and a specificity of 72.0 % ( AUC 0.81 , P = 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	With this cut-off , the agreement between a clinical and echocardiographic response was only 57.4 % ( 35 patients ) .
RESULTS	On Cox regression analysis , RV-ESA change emerged as the only independent predictor of event-free survival , whereas subjective clinical improvement did not .
CONCLUSIONS	A discrepancy between subjective and echocardiographic improvement at 6 months after isolated TR surgery was observed in 42.6 % of the patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Echocardiographic RV reverse remodeling , but not subjective clinical amelioration , was a strong prognosticator after surgery .

OBJECTIVE	The effects of acute continuous positive airway pressure therapy on left ventricular diastolic function and functional capacity in patients with compensated systolic heart failure remain unclear .
METHODS	This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial included 43 patients with heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.50 who were in functional classes I-III according to the New York Heart Association criteria .
METHODS	Twenty-three patients were assigned to continuous positive airway pressure therapy ( 10 cmH2O ) , while 20 patients received placebo with null pressure for 30 minutes .
METHODS	All patients underwent a 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) and Doppler echocardiography before and immediately after intervention .
METHODS	Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT01088854 .
RESULTS	The groups had similar clinical and echocardiographic baseline variables .
RESULTS	Variation in the diastolic function index ( e ' ) after intervention was associated with differences in the distance walked in both groups .
RESULTS	However , in the continuous positive airway pressure group , this difference was greater ( continuous positive airway pressure group : 6MWT = 9.44 +16.05 e ' , p = 0.002 ; sham group : 6MWT = 7.49 +5.38 e ' ; p = 0.015 ) .
RESULTS	There was a statistically significant interaction between e ' index variation and continuous positive airway pressure for the improvement of functional capacity ( p = 0.020 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Continuous positive airway pressure does not acurately change the echocardiographic indexes of left ventricle systolic or diastolic function in patients with compensated systolic heart failure .
CONCLUSIONS	However , 30-minute continuous positive airway pressure therapy appears to have an effect on left ventricular diastolic function by increasing functional capacity .

OBJECTIVE	To explore if cognitive impairment in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) is associated with abnormal neural function and if there is evidence of neural compensatory mechanisms .
METHODS	Seventy-two RRMS patients and 89 healthy control subjects were included in a cross-sectional study .
METHODS	Event-related brain potential ( P300 ) and response time ( RT ) were recorded with visual and auditory choice reaction tasks .
METHODS	Cognitive function was evaluated with an 18 item test battery .
RESULTS	Patients had a decrease in cognitive function ( p < 0.001 for global score ) and increased visual P300 amplitude frontally .
RESULTS	P300 amplitude was normal in other brain areas and RT was normal .
RESULTS	P300 latency was normal except for an increase in auditory latency occipitally .
RESULTS	Cognitive performance correlated positively with parietal P300 amplitude in patients but not in controls .
RESULTS	Cognition had stronger correlation ( negative ) with RT in patients than in controls .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with low P300 amplitude and long RT were more often cognitively impaired .
CONCLUSIONS	This indicates that general factors such as signal amplitude and speed are limiting for cognitive function in RRMS patients .
CONCLUSIONS	The increase in frontal P300 amplitude may be a compensatory effect .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings suggest that high amplitude and fast speed may be protective against cognitive impairment .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the sedative and clinical effects of the pharmacopuncture with xylazine , compared to the conventional dose of a intramuscular injection in dogs .
METHODS	Twelve dogs were randomly distributed in two groups of six animals and treated as follows : control group ( X-IM ) : 1mg kg ( -1 ) of xylazine given intramuscularly ( IM ) ; pharmacopuncture group ( X-Yintang ) : 0.1 mg kg ( -1 ) of xylazine diluted to 0.5 mL of saline injected into the Yin Tang acupoint .
METHODS	Heart rate , cardiac rhythm ( ECG ) , systolic arterial blood pressure ( SABP ) , respiratory rate ( RR ) , rectal temperature ( RT ) , blood glucose concentration , degree of sedation and adverse effects were evaluated .
RESULTS	Sedative effect was observed in both groups .
RESULTS	The degree of sedation was greater in X-IM only at 15 min when compared with X-Yintang group .
RESULTS	Cardiovascular established was observed in X-Yintang group , while marked reduction in the HR and increased incidence of ECG abnormalities were detected in X-IM .
RESULTS	In both treatment groups , minimal changes were observed in relation to SABP , RR , RT and blood glucose .
RESULTS	High incidence ( 66 % ) of vomiting was observed in X-IM , while this adverse effect was absent in X-Yintang .
CONCLUSIONS	Pharmacopuncture with xylazine induced clinically relevant sedative effects in dogs , with the advantage of reduction of undesirable side effects associated with 2-agonists , including bradycardia , cardiac arrhythmias , and emesis .

BACKGROUND	Poor adherence to inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS ) is a critical risk factor contributing to asthma morbidity among low-income minority adolescents .
OBJECTIVE	This trial tested whether peer support group meetings and peer asthma messages delivered via mp3 players improved adherence to ICS .
METHODS	Low-income African American and/or Hispanic adolescents , ages 11-16 years old , with persistent asthma , and poor ( 48 % ) adherence to prescription ICS during the 3-week run-in were randomized to intervention or attention control groups ( ATG ) for the 10-week treatment .
METHODS	During treatment , the intervention arm subjects participated in weekly coping peer group support sessions and received mp3 peer-recorded asthma messages that promoted adherence .
METHODS	The ATG participated in weekly meetings with a research assistant and received an equivalent number of mp3 physician-recorded asthma messages .
METHODS	Adherence was measured by using self-report and the Doser CT , an electronic dose counter .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the difference in adherence at 10 weeks between the 2 arms .
RESULTS	Thirty-four subjects were randomized to each arm .
RESULTS	At 10 weeks , no statistical difference in objectively measured adherence could be detected between the 2 arms when adjusting for baseline adherence ( P = .929 ) .
RESULTS	Adherence declined in both groups over the course of the active treatment period .
RESULTS	In both study arms , self-reported adherence by participants was significantly higher than their objectively measured adherence at week 10 ( P < .0001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Improving medication adherence in longitudinal studies is challenging .
CONCLUSIONS	Peer support and mp3-delivered peer asthma messages may not be of sufficient dose to improve outcomes .

BACKGROUND	Recent studies have demonstrated higher-quality chest compressions ( CCs ) following a 60 s ultra-brief video ( UBV ) on compression-only CPR ( CO-CPR ) .
BACKGROUND	However , the effectiveness of UBVs as a CPR-teaching tool for lay bystanders in public venues remains unknown .
OBJECTIVE	Determine whether an UBV is effective in teaching laypersons CO-CPR in a public setting and if viewing leads to superior responsiveness and CPR skills .
METHODS	Adult lay bystanders were enrolled in a public shopping mall and randomized to : ( 1 ) Control ( CTR ) : sat idle for 60 s ; ( 2 ) UBV : watched a 60 s UBV on CO-CPR .
METHODS	Subjects were read a scenario detailing a sudden collapse in the mall and asked to do what they `` thought was best '' on a mannequin .
METHODS	Performance measures were recorded for 2 min : responsiveness ( time to call 911 and first CCs ) and CPR quality [ CC depth , rate , hands-off interval ( time without CC after first CC ) ] .
RESULTS	One hundred subjects were enrolled .
RESULTS	Demographics were similar between groups .
RESULTS	UBV subjects called 911 more frequently ( percent difference : 31 % ) and initiated CCs sooner in the arrest scenario ( median difference ( MD ) : 5 s ) .
RESULTS	UBV cohort had increased CC rate ( MD : 19 cpm ) and decreased hands-off interval ( MD : 27 s ) .
RESULTS	There was no difference in CC depth .
CONCLUSIONS	Bystanders with UBV training in a shopping mall had significantly improved responsiveness , CC rate , and decreased hands-off interval .
CONCLUSIONS	Given the short length of training , UBV may have potential as a ubiquitous intervention for public venues to help improve bystander reaction to arrest and CO-CPR performance .

BACKGROUND	Prior studies show that adaptive servoventilation ( ASV ) is initially more effective than continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) for patients with complex sleep apnea syndrome ( CompSAS ) , but choosing therapies has been controversial because residual central breathing events may resolve over time in many patients receiving chronic CPAP therapy .
BACKGROUND	We conducted a multicenter , randomized , prospective trial comparing clinical and polysomnographic outcomes over prolonged treatment of patients with CompSAS , with CPAP versus ASV .
METHODS	Qualifying participants meeting criteria for CompSAS were randomized to optimized CPAP or ASV treatment .
METHODS	Clinical and polysomnographic data were obtained at baseline and after 90 days of therapy .
RESULTS	We randomized 66 participants ( 33 to each treatment ) .
RESULTS	At baseline , the diagnostic apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) was 37.7 27.8 ( central apnea index [ CAI ] = 3.2 5.8 ) and best CPAP AHI was 37.0 24.9 ( CAI 29.7 25.0 ) .
RESULTS	After second-night treatment titration , the AHI was 4.7 8.1 ( CAI = 1.1 3.7 ) on ASV and 14.1 20.7 ( CAI = 8.8 16.3 ) on CPAP ( P 0.0003 ) .
RESULTS	At 90 days , the ASV versus CPAP AHI was 4.4 9.6 versus 9.9 11.1 ( P = 0.0024 ) and CAI was 0.7 3.4 versus 4.8 6.4 ( P < 0.0001 ) , respectively .
RESULTS	In the intention-to-treat analysis , success ( AHI < 10 ) at 90 days of therapy was achieved in 89.7 % versus 64.5 % of participants treated with ASV and CPAP , respectively ( P = 0.0214 ) .
RESULTS	Compliance and changes in Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index were not significantly different between treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Adaptive servoventilation ( ASV ) was more reliably effective than CPAP in relieving complex sleep apnea syndrome .
CONCLUSIONS	While two thirds of participants experienced success with CPAP , approximately 90 % experienced success with ASV .
CONCLUSIONS	Because both methods produced similar symptomatic changes , it is unclear if this polysomnographic effectiveness may translate into other desired outcomes .
RESULTS	Clinicaltrials.Gov NCT00915499 .

OBJECTIVE	The assessment of myocardial fatty acid metabolism impairment by single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) using ( 123 ) I -- methyliodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid ( BMIPP ) might predict the risk of cardiac death in hemodialysis patients .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated the potential of oral nicorandil to improve myocardial fatty acid metabolism after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) in this population .
METHODS	We evaluated 128 hemodialysis patients who had obtained coronary revascularization by PCI ( 90 men and 38 women , 66 9 years ) .
METHODS	Participants for the analysis were randomly assigned to either the nicorandil ( n = 63 ) or control group ( n = 65 ) .
METHODS	BMIPP SPECT was performed every year after coronary revascularization by PCI .
METHODS	Uptake on SPECT was graded in 17 segments on a 5-point scale ( 0 , normal ; 4 , absent ) and assessed as BMIPP summed scores ( SS ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of cardiac death was lower ( p = 0.004 ) in the nicorandil group ( 7/63 , 11.1 % ) than in the control group ( 21/65 , 32.3 % ) during a mean follow-up of 2.7 1.4 years .
RESULTS	BMIPP SS reduction rates improved in the nicorandil group compared with the control group from 3 years of administration .
RESULTS	In Kaplan-Meier analyses , free survival rate of cardiac death was higher in patients with a 20 % BMIPP SS reduction rate as compared with those with a < 20 % BMIPP SS reduction rate ( p = 0.0001 ) .
RESULTS	In multiple logistic analysis , oral administration of nicorandil was associated with 20 % reduction rates of BMIPP SS ( odds ratio 2.823 , p = 0.011 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-term oral administration of nicorandil may improve impaired myocardial fatty acid metabolism after coronary revascularization by PCI in hemodialysis patients .

BACKGROUND	The immunogenicity and safety of the investigational diphtheria , tetanus , acellular pertussis , hepatitis B , poliomyelitis , Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) and meningococcal serogroup C ( MenC ) heptavalent combination vaccine were compared with those of licensed control vaccines .
METHODS	In this open , phase II , randomized study ( NCT01090453 ) , 480 infants from Germany , France and Canada received the heptavalent vaccine ( Hepta group ) or hexavalent and monovalent MenC control vaccines ( HexaMenC group ) co-administered with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine at 2 , 4 and 12 months of age .
METHODS	Immunogenicity was measured 1 month after the second primary dose , and before and 1 month after the booster dose .
METHODS	Safety and reactogenicity were also evaluated .
RESULTS	Non-inferiority of immune responses to MenC and Hib induced by 2-dose primary vaccination with the heptavalent vaccine versus control vaccines was demonstrated .
RESULTS	In exploratory analyses , postprimary and postbooster functional antibody geometric mean titers against MenC tended to be lower ( 1119.5 vs. 3200.5 ; 2653.8 vs. 6028.4 ) and antibody geometric mean concentrations against Hib higher ( 1.594 vs. 0.671 g/mL ; 17.678 vs. 13.737 g/mL ) in the Hepta versus the HexaMenC group .
RESULTS	The heptavalent and control vaccines were immunogenic to all other antigens , although immune responses to poliovirus were lower than expected in both groups .
RESULTS	No differences in safety and reactogenicity profiles were detected between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The heptavalent vaccine induced non-inferior MenC and Hib responses compared with control vaccines .
CONCLUSIONS	Both vaccination regimens , when administered at 2 , 4 and 12 months of age , had comparable safety profiles and were immunogenic to all antigens , with lower-than-expected responses to poliomyelitis .

OBJECTIVE	The phase III EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE trials demonstrated the potential of oral rivaroxaban for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and pulmonary embolism ( PE ) .
OBJECTIVE	The length of initial hospitalization in patients presenting with either symptomatic DVT or PE was assessed using hospitalization records from these trials .
METHODS	Analyses were carried out in the intention-to-treat population , using non-parametric and parametric statistical methods .
RESULTS	Overall , 52 % ( 1781/3434 ) of EINSTEIN DVT patients and 90 % ( 4328/4821 ) of EINSTEIN PE patients were admitted to hospital .
RESULTS	The proportion of hospitalized patients with a length of stay of five or fewer days receiving rivaroxaban was 54 % compared with 31 % for enoxaparin/vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) in patients with DVT .
RESULTS	For patients with PE , the corresponding values were 45 % and 33 % .
RESULTS	Stays of 6-10 days were observed in 29 % of rivaroxaban-treated patients compared with 45 % of enoxaparin/VKA-treated patients for DVT .
RESULTS	For patients with PE , these values were 39 % and 46 % in the rivaroxaban and enoxaparin/VKA groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Overall , length of stay was significantly shorter in the rivaroxaban group , compared with the enoxaparin/VKA group across all analyses performed ( p < 0.0001 ) .
RESULTS	Across regions , the observed admission rates and length of stay duration varied greatly : Asia had the longest overall hospitalization rates , whereas the lowest rates were reported in North America , Australia and New Zealand .
RESULTS	Nevertheless , a consistent trend was observed : length of hospital stay in patients with DVT or PE receiving rivaroxaban was shorter than , or at least similar to , patients receiving enoxaparin/VKA .
CONCLUSIONS	A single-drug regimen with rivaroxaban may reduce the burden on healthcare systems and patients , and provides effective and well tolerated treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	The studies shared an open-label design that allowed comparison of initial hospitalization , but limitations include the well monitored clinical trial setting in which decisions on admission and discharge could vary from real-world management .

BACKGROUND	Identification of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease in the intestinal tract by PET/computed tomography ( CT ) imaging can be hampered by physiological uptake of F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( F-FDG ) in the normal colon .
BACKGROUND	Previous work has localized this F-FDG uptake to the intestinal lumen , predominantly occupied by bacteria .
BACKGROUND	We sought to determine whether pretreatment with an antibiotic could reduce F-FDG uptake in the healthy colon .
METHODS	Thirty patients undergoing restaging PET/CT for nongastrointestinal lymphoma were randomly selected to receive rifaximin 550 mg twice daily for 2 days before their scan ( post-rifaximin ) .
METHODS	Their PET/CT images were compared with those from their prior study ( pre-rifaximin ) .
METHODS	Cecal maximum standard uptake value ( SUVmax ) and overall colonic F-FDG uptake were compared between scans .
METHODS	All PET/CT images were blindly scored by a radiologist .
METHODS	The same comparison of sequential scans was also undertaken in 30 patients who did not receive antibiotics .
RESULTS	Thirty post-rifaximin scans were compared with 30 pre-rifaximin scans in the same patients .
RESULTS	SUVmax in the cecum was significantly lower in the patient 's post-rifaximin scans than in their pre-rifaximin scans ( P = 0.002 ) .
RESULTS	The percentage of scans with greater than grade 1 colonic F-FDG uptake was significantly lower in the post-rifaximin scans than in the pre-rifaximin scans ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	In contrast , there was no significant difference in the paired sequential scans from control patients , nor a reduction in the percentage of scans with greater than grade 1 colonic F-FDG uptake .
CONCLUSIONS	This pilot study shows that treatment with rifaximin for 2 days before PET/CT scanning can significantly reduce physiological F-FDG uptake in the normal colonic lumen .

OBJECTIVE	Bioequivalence and comparability studies are necessary for changing formulations of large-molecule drugs , such as antibody drugs and protein products , and in the development of their biosimilars .
OBJECTIVE	This study is the first application of modeling and simulation ( M&S ) in the design of bioequivalence and comparability studies of erythropoietin as an example of a large-molecule drug .
METHODS	A novel population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic ( PPK/PD ) model was developed for erythropoietin .
METHODS	Based on this PPK/PD model , the probabilities of success of bioequivalence and comparability studies were simulated with various numbers of subjects and samples .
RESULTS	The simulation indicated that the minimum numbers of subjects and samples required to satisfy the criteria for bioequivalence and comparability studies were as follows : fewest for the area under the serum concentration-time curve , more for the area under the efficacy-time curve , and most for the maximum serum concentration of erythropoietin .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggested that M&S could be successfully applied in the design of bioequivalence and comparability studies of large-molecule drugs .

BACKGROUND	A previous multicenter clinical trial of a needle-based fractional radiofrequency ( FRF ) treatment for facial and neck rhytides and laxity counterintuitively demonstrated a mean target temperature and treatment duration of 69.5 C and 4.9 seconds for subjects with lesser improvement and 67 C and 4.2 seconds for greater improvement .
OBJECTIVE	To determine optimal temperature and duration settings for maximal clinical results in rhytides and laxity from a single FRF treatment of the face and neck .
METHODS	A randomized , blinded , 3-arm clinical evaluation of FRF at a series of temperatures from 52-57 C to 67 C. Three blinded plastic surgeons and dermatologists scored rhytides using the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Assessment Scale and laxity using the Alexiades Laxity Assessment Scale at 1 , 3 , and 6 months .
RESULTS	Blinded grading showed optimal improvement at 67 C and 3 seconds and decreased efficacy below 67 C , with mean rhytide reductions of 40 , 29 , and 25 % and mean laxity reductions of 34 , 36 , and 25 % in Arms 3 ( 67 C ) , 2 ( 62 C ) , and 1 ( 52 C-57 C ) , respectively .
RESULTS	A 100 % response rate was observed for all subjects treated at 62 C to 67 C target temperature .
CONCLUSIONS	The optimal target dermal temperature for facial and neck rhytide and laxity treatment is 67 C and duration of 3 to 4 seconds with a 100 % response rate after a single FRF treatment .

BACKGROUND	To reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance , there is a pressing need for worldwide implementation of effective interventions to promote more prudent prescribing of antibiotics for acute LRTI .
BACKGROUND	This study is a process analysis of the GRACE/INTRO trial of a multifactorial intervention that reduced antibiotic prescribing for acute LRTI in six European countries .
BACKGROUND	The aim was to understand how the interventions were implemented and to examine effects of the interventions on general practitioners ' ( GPs ' ) and patients ' attitudes .
METHODS	GPs were cluster randomised to one of three intervention groups or a control group .
METHODS	The intervention groups received web-based training in either use of the C-reactive protein ( CRP ) test , communication skills and use of a patient booklet , or training in both .
METHODS	GP attitudes were measured before and after the intervention using constructs from the Theory of Planned Behaviour and a Website Satisfaction Questionnaire .
METHODS	Effects of the interventions on patients were assessed by a post-intervention questionnaire assessing patient enablement , satisfaction with the consultation , and beliefs about the risks and need for antibiotics .
RESULTS	GPs in all countries and intervention groups had very positive perceptions of the intervention and the web-based training , and felt that taking part had helped them to reduce prescribing .
RESULTS	All GPs perceived reducing prescribing as more important and less risky following the intervention , and GPs in the communication groups reported increased confidence to reduce prescribing .
RESULTS	Patients in the communication groups who received the booklet reported the highest levels of enablement and satisfaction and had greater awareness that antibiotics could be unnecessary and harmful .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings suggest that the interventions should be broadly acceptable to both GPs and patients , as well as feasible to roll out more widely across Europe .
CONCLUSIONS	There are also some indications that they could help to engender changes in GP and patient attitudes that will be helpful in the longer-term , such as increased awareness of the potential disadvantages of antibiotics and increased confidence to manage LRTI without them .
CONCLUSIONS	Given the positive effects of the booklet on patient beliefs and attitudes , it seems logical to extend the use of the patient booklet to all patients .

OBJECTIVE	Durable post-treatment response is uncommon in chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) patients on nucleos ( t ) ide analogue therapy .
OBJECTIVE	Response , response predictors and safety were assessed in patients who switched from long-term entecavir ( ETV ) to peginterferon alfa-2a .
METHODS	Hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) - positive CHB patients who had received ETV for 9-36 months , with HBeAg < 100 PEIU/ml and HBV DNA 1000 copies/ml , were randomised 1:1 to receive peginterferon alfa-2a 180 g/week or ETV 0.5 mg/day for 48 weeks .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was HBeAg seroconversion at week 48 ( ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT00940485 ) .
RESULTS	200 patients were randomised ; 197 received 1 study drug dose .
RESULTS	Five patients who were anti-HBe-positive at baseline were excluded from the modified intention-to-treat population ( peginterferon alfa-2a , n = 94 ; ETV , n = 98 ) .
RESULTS	Patients who switched to peginterferon alfa-2a achieved higher week 48 HBeAg seroconversion rates vs. those who continued ETV ( 14.9 % vs. 6.1 % ; p = 0.0467 ) .
RESULTS	Only patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a achieved HBsAg loss ( 8.5 % ) .
RESULTS	Among peginterferon alfa-2a-treated patients with HBeAg loss and HBsAg < 1500 IU/ml at randomisation , 33.3 % and 22.2 % achieved HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss , respectively .
RESULTS	Early on-treatment HBsAg decline predicted response at week 48 ; highest rates were observed in patients with week 12 HBsAg < 200 IU/ml ( HBeAg seroconversion , 66.7 % ; HBsAg loss , 77.8 % ) .
RESULTS	Alanine aminotransferase elevations were not associated with viral rebound ( n = 38 ) .
RESULTS	Peginterferon alfa-2a was well-tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	For patients who achieve virological suppression with ETV , switching to a finite course of peginterferon alfa-2a significantly increases rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss .
CONCLUSIONS	A response-guided approach may identify patients with the greatest chance of success .

OBJECTIVE	To estimate effect sizes for a trial to compare preventable pulmonary complications ( PPCs ) , turning-related adverse events , mechanical ventilation duration , intensive care unit ( ICU ) length of stay , and ICU mortality between patients randomized to 2-hourly manual or continuous automated lateral rotation .
METHODS	Randomized controlled trial pilot study with 15 patients selected randomly from eligible medical-surgical ICU patients from 2 tertiary hospitals and assigned randomly to the manual-turn or automated-turn protocol for up to 7 consecutive days .
METHODS	A radiologist blinded to group and site assessed serial chest radiographs for PPCs .
METHODS	Repeated-measures analysis with linear mixed models was used to estimate change in PPC score , and Wilcoxon rank sum or Fisher exact test was used to compare group differences in the secondary outcomes .
RESULTS	Of 16 patients enrolled , 12 ( 75 % ) completed the study .
RESULTS	Data from 15 patients , 7 manual turn and 8 automated turn , were analyzed .
RESULTS	Between-group differences in PPC incidence ( 67 % overall ) , change in PPC score ( = 0.15 , manual turn and = -0.44 , automated turn ) , and secondary outcomes were not significant ( P > .05 ) .
RESULTS	Standardized effect sizes were small to moderate for the outcome variables .
RESULTS	A sample size of 54 patients would be needed to detect statistically significant between-group differences in PPC over time .
CONCLUSIONS	The incidence of PPCs in adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation in a medical-surgical ICU was high .
CONCLUSIONS	Automated turning decreased PPCs with time but had little effect on secondary outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Safety outcomes were not substantially different between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	A modest efficacy effect supported reduced PPCs with automated turning to the lateral position .

BACKGROUND	There are so many studies associating blood pressure in children and adolescents with body fatness i.e. stating that high body fat is associated with high blood pressure in children and adolescents .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to determine that which portion of the body mass index , fat or fat free mass index is more influencing the blood pressure in Gujarati Indian adolescents .
METHODS	733 schoolchildren of 10-18 years of both genders were chosen for this study .
METHODS	The body fat percentage and blood pressure were measured and on the basis of body mass and fat mass , fat free mass index and various other indices were calculated .
METHODS	The association of fat mass index and fat free mass index with blood pressure was computed using correlations .
RESULTS	The relationship of BMI with mean blood pressure of boys ( R = .326 ) was more strong than that in girls ( R = .149 ) .
RESULTS	The blood pressure was having more strong positive correlation with lean body mass index than that with fat mass index in all subjects ( R = 0.230 versus R = 0.184 ) , boys ( R = 0.285 versus R = 0.242 ) , & girls ( R = 0.179 versus R = -0.081 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Fat free mass index has more strong association with blood pressure than fat mass index in the adolescent population irrespective of gender .
CONCLUSIONS	However as far as prevention of hypertension is concerned , reducing body fat ( rather than only body weight ) may remain an important measure to prevent hypertension as body fat mass is reducible while lean body mass may not be reducible and , in long term , obesity itself can lead to hypertension by various mechanisms .

BACKGROUND	Forming ` habit ' - defined as a learned process that generates automatic responses to contextual cues - has been suggested as a mechanism for behaviour maintenance , but few studies have applied habit theory to behaviour change .
BACKGROUND	This study used process evaluation data , taken from a randomised controlled trial of a healthy child-feeding intervention for parents previously shown to be effective , to explore the applicability to dietary behaviour change of predictions and recommendations drawn from habit theory .
BACKGROUND	The intervention supported parents in pursuing child-feeding habit goals in three domains ( giving fruit and vegetables , water , healthy snacks ) , over four fortnightly home visits .
BACKGROUND	We explored whether ( a ) the habit-formation model was acceptable to participants , ( b ) better-specified habit-formation goals yielded greater habit gains , and ( c ) habit gains were sustained ( d ) even when subsequent , new habit goals were pursued .
METHODS	Qualitative and quantitative data were taken from 57 parents randomised to the intervention arm , and so analyses presented here used a pre-post intervention design .
METHODS	Thematic analysis of post-intervention qualitative interviews evaluated acceptability , and self-reported habit goals were content-analysed .
METHODS	ANOVAs explored changes in habit strength , recorded at home visits and one - and two-month follow-ups , across time and goals .
RESULTS	Participants understood and engaged positively with the habit-formation approach .
RESULTS	Although many seemingly poorly-specified habit goals were set , goal characteristics had minimal impact on habit strength , which were achieved within two weeks for all behaviours ( p 's < .001 ) , and were maintained or had increased further by the final follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	The habit-formation model appears to be an acceptable and fruitful basis for dietary behaviour change .

OBJECTIVE	N-acetyltransferase 2 ( NAT2 ) is involved in the metabolism of various environmental substances , both with and without carcinogenic potential .
OBJECTIVE	Alcoholic and nonalcoholic caffeine-rich beverages may be associated with markers of inflammation .
OBJECTIVE	Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a chronic , multifaceted inflammatory disease .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated the effects of alcoholic and nonalcoholic caffeine-rich beverages on risk of SLE and determined whether the effects were modified by NAT2 status .
METHODS	The NAT2 polymorphism was genotyped in 152 SLE cases and 427 healthy controls , all women and Japanese .
METHODS	We assessed effect modification by testing an interaction term for the NAT2 polymorphism and consumption of beverages .
RESULTS	Consumption of black tea ( odds ratio [ OR ] 1.88 , 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % CI ] 1.03-3 .41 ) and coffee ( OR 1.57 , 95 % CI 0.95-2 .61 ) , but not green tea , was associated with an increased risk of SLE , while alcohol use ( OR 0.33 , 95 % CI 0.20-0 .55 ) was associated with a decreased risk of SLE .
RESULTS	There were significant interactions between the NAT2 polymorphism and either alcohol use ( Pinteraction = 0.026 ) or consumption of black tea ( Pinteraction = 0.048 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The NAT2 polymorphism significantly modified the effects of alcohol use and black tea consumption on SLE , emphasizing the importance of incorporating genetic and metabolic information in studies on management of SLE .
CONCLUSIONS	Additional studies are warranted to confirm the findings suggested in this study .

OBJECTIVE	To examine the effects of 12 weeks of periodized resistance training ( RT ) with and without combined creatine and whey protein supplementation on changes in body composition , muscular strength , and functional performance .
METHODS	Twenty-two male volunteers ( 68.1 6.1 years ) were randomly assigned to one of three groups : RT plus supplementation ( RTS , n = 7 ) ; RT only ( RT , n = 7 ) ; or control ( C , n = 8 ) .
METHODS	RTS consumed 0.3 g/kg/day of creatine for 5 days followed by 0.07 g/kg/day .
METHODS	RTS also consumed one 35 g liquid protein ready-to-drink daily .
METHODS	RT and RTS trained 3 days/week .
RESULTS	Following 12 weeks of training , there were no significant differences in the main measured outcome variables between RT and RTS .
RESULTS	RTS increased relative ( % change ) lean body mass ( LBM , 3.3 3.1 % ) compared with C ( p = 0.01 ) .
RESULTS	Compared to baseline , RT increased LBM at week 6 ( 60.2 8.3 to 61.6 9.4 kg ; p < 0.05 ) , and decreased fat mass ( 20.8 4.2 to 19.0 3.9 kg ; p = 0.05 ) and percentage body fat at week 12 ( 25.7 3.8 to 23.8 4.0 % ; p = 0.05 ) ; RTS increased LBM at week 6 ( p < 0.01 ) and week 12 ( 56.4 4.3 to 58.2 3.4 kg ; p < 0.01 ) , and decreased percentage body fat at week 12 ( 23.9 4.4 to 22.0 4.4 % ; p < 0.01 ) .
RESULTS	In addition , compared to C , relative bench press 1-RM increased for RTS ( 72.4 62.2 % ; p < 0.01 ) and RT ( 50.1 21.5 % ; p = 0.05 ) ; relative leg press 1-RM increased for RTS ( 129.6 39.4 % ; p < 0.0001 ) and RT ( 112.9 22.7 % ; p < 0.0001 ) ; RTS increased relative Margaria stair-climbing power ( 38.3 30.4 % ; p < 0.05 ) ; and , relative 400-m walk time decreased for RT ( -11 9.2 % ; p < 0.05 ) and RTS ( -9.6 9.4 % ; p = 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	RT increased estimated VO2Max at week 6 ( p < 0.01 ) and 12 ( 34.6 1.9 to 36.4 2.7 ml/kg/min ; p = 0.01 ) compared to baseline .
RESULTS	Lastly , RTS increased estimated VO2Max at week 12 ( 36.3 2.7 to 37.5 3.3 ml/kg/min ; p = 0.05 ) compared to baseline .
CONCLUSIONS	Creatine and whey protein supplementation may not provide additional benefits in older adults performing periodized RT to augment muscular and functional performance .

OBJECTIVE	Our previous study found that cortical gray matter ( cGM ) volume predicted vascular cognitive impairment independent of age-related white matter changes ( WMC ) .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to investigate predictors for cGM volume in ischemic stroke patients with confluent WMC .
METHODS	One-hundred post-stroke patients with confluent WMC were recruited into the study .
METHODS	All volumetric measures were standardized by intracranial volume as volume ratio .
METHODS	Univariate analyses and multivariate linear regression models were used to test relationship of cGM volume with basic demography , vascular risk factors , APOE status , WMC volume ( periventricular and deep WMC ) , infarct measures ( volume , number and location ) and microbleed ( number , presence and location ) .
RESULTS	After controlling for significant variables in the univariate analyses , multivariate linear regression models found that old age ( = -0.288 , p = 0.001 ) , low triglyceride ( = 0.194 , p = 0.027 ) , periventricular WMC ( PVWMC ) ( = -0.392 , p < 0.001 ) and presence of thalamic microbleed ( = -0.197 , p = 0.041 ) were independently predictive of less cGM volume ratio .
CONCLUSIONS	Age , PVWMC and left thalamic microbleed predict less cGM volume .
