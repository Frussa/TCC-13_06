BACKGROUND	Alcohol consumption of college students has a fluctuating nature , which might impact the measurement of intervention effects .
BACKGROUND	By using 25 follow-up time-points , this study tested whether intervention effects are robust or might vary over time .
METHODS	Data were used from a two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial applying ecological momentary assessment ( EMA ) with 30 data time-points in total .
METHODS	Students between 18 and 24 years old who reported heavy drinking in the past six months and who were ready to change their alcohol consumption were randomly assigned to the experimental ( n = 456 : web-based brief alcohol intervention ) and control condition ( n = 451 : no intervention ) .
METHODS	Outcome measures were weekly alcohol consumption , frequency of binge drinking , and heavy drinking status .
RESULTS	According to the intention-to-treat principle , regression analyses revealed that intervention effects on alcohol consumption varied when exploring multiple follow-up time-points .
RESULTS	Intervention effects were found for a ) weekly alcohol consumption at 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 7 weeks follow-up , b ) frequency of binge drinking at 1 , 2 , 7 , and 12 weeks follow-up , and c ) heavy drinking status at 1 , 2 , 7 , and 16 weeks follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	This research showed that the commonly used one and six month follow-up time-points are relatively arbitrary and not using EMA might bring forth erroneous conclusions on the effectiveness of interventions .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , future trials in alcohol prevention research and beyond are encouraged to apply EMA when assessing outcome measures and intervention effectiveness .

BACKGROUND	Using phase 3 trial data for sunitinib versus interferon ( IFN ) - in treatment-naive patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma , retrospective analyses characterized sunitinib-associated fatigue and its impact on patient-reported health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) .
METHODS	Patients received sunitinib at a dose of 50 mg/day on a schedule of 4 weeks on/2 weeks off ( 375 patients ) or IFN - at a dose of 9 MU subcutaneously 3 times per week ( 360 patients ) .
METHODS	HRQoL was self-assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index-15-item ( FKSI-15 ) questionnaire , with fatigue assessed using its Disease-Related Symptoms subscale .
METHODS	Fatigue was also assessed by providers using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) .
METHODS	A repeated-measures model ( M1 ) and random intercept-slope model ( M2 ) characterized sunitinib-associated fatigue over time .
METHODS	Another repeated-measures model examined the relationship between HRQoL scores and CTCAE fatigue grade .
RESULTS	M1 demonstrated that the initial increase in patient-reported fatigue with sunitinib was worst during cycle 1 , with mean values numerically better at subsequent cycles ; most pairwise comparisons of consecutive CTCAE fatigue cycle means were not found to be statistically significant .
RESULTS	M2 demonstrated that the overall trend ( slope ) for patient-reported and CTCAE fatigue with sunitinib was not statistically different from 0 .
RESULTS	The relationship between most HRQoL scores and CTCAE fatigue was close to linear regardless of treatment , with lower scores ( worse HRQoL ) corresponding to higher fatigue grade .
RESULTS	The majority of HRQoL scores were better with sunitinib versus IFN - for the same CTCAE fatigue grade .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients reported worse fatigue during the first sunitinib cycle .
CONCLUSIONS	However , in subsequent consecutive cycles , less fatigue was reported with no statistically significant worsening .
CONCLUSIONS	CTCAE fatigue assessment may not fully capture patient treatment experience .

OBJECTIVE	Endogenous anterior uveitis ( AU ) , when untreated , may lead to vision loss .
OBJECTIVE	This study compared the safety and efficacy of difluprednate versus prednisolone acetate for the treatment of this condition .
METHODS	This phase III , double-masked , noninferiority study randomized patients with mild to moderate endogenous AU to receive difluprednate 0.05 % ( n = 56 ) four times daily , alternating with vehicle four times daily , or prednisolone acetate 1 % ( n = 54 ) eight times daily .
METHODS	The 14-day treatment period was followed by a 14-day dose-tapering period and a 14-day observation period .
METHODS	The primary efficacy end point was change in anterior chamber cell grade ( range , 0 for 1 cell to 4 for > 50 cells ) from baseline to day 14 .
RESULTS	At day 14 , the mean change in anterior chamber cell grade with difluprednate was noninferior to that with prednisolone acetate ( -2.2 vs. -2.0 , P = 0.16 ) .
RESULTS	The proportions of difluprednate-treated patients versus prednisolone acetate-treated patients demonstrating complete clearing of anterior chamber cells at day 3 were 13.0 % vs. 2.1 % ( P = 0.046 ) and at day 21 were 73.9 % vs. 63.8 % ( P = 0.013 ) .
RESULTS	A significant between-group difference in the mean IOP increase was seen at day 3 ( 2.5 mm Hg for difluprednate-treated patients and 0.1 mm Hg for prednisolone acetate-treated patients , P = 0.0013 ) but not at other time points .
RESULTS	The mean IOP values in both groups remained less than 21 mm Hg throughout the study .
CONCLUSIONS	Difluprednate 0.05 % four times daily is well tolerated and is noninferior to prednisolone acetate 1 % eight times daily for the treatment of endogenous AU .
CONCLUSIONS	( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT01201798 . )

METHODS	In the meridian points group , Lianquan ( CV 23 ) , Futu ( LI 18 ) , Tongli ( HT 5 ) , Hegu ( LI 4 ) and the others were selected .
METHODS	Electroacupuncture was used in the two groups , dense-dispersion wave , retaining for 30 min .
METHODS	The treatment was given once a day , 5 treatments a week .
METHODS	Totally , 4 weeks were required .
METHODS	The symptom scores of speech and swallowing dysfunction were observed before and after treatment in the two groups .
METHODS	The efficacy was compared between the two groups .
RESULTS	The scores of speech and swallowing dysfunction were improved significantly after treatment in the two groups ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) .
RESULTS	The results in the neck-occiput points group were better than those in the meridian points group ( both P < 0.01 ) .
RESULTS	The curative rate of speech dysfunction was 30.6 % ( 11/36 ) and that of swallowing dysfunction was 22.2 % ( 8 / 36 ) in the neck-occiput points group , which were better than 11.1 % ( 4/36 ) and 5.6 % ( 2/36 ) in the meridian points group , respectively .
RESULTS	The differences were significant in comparison of the two groups ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Electroacupuncture at eight-neck-occiput points achieves a better efficacy on speech and swallowing dysfunction of MOP after brainstem infarction as compared with the routine acupoints .
CONCLUSIONS	This therapy is characterized as more accurate point localization and safer operation .

BACKGROUND	Wet-wrap treatment ( WWT ) has been advocated as a relatively effective treatment in children with severe atopic dermatitis ( AD ) .
BACKGROUND	WWT often serves as crisis intervention for AD .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to evaluate the use of WWT with diluted corticosteroids in comparison with emollient in children with severe AD during 4 weeks in a proactive schedule during which the frequency of corticosteroid applications was tapered .
METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study was performed in children aged 6 months to 10 years with severe AD ( objective SCORAD at least 40 5 ) , comparing WWT with diluted corticosteroids ( 1:3 mometasone furoate 0.1 % ointment and for the face 1:19 mometasone furoate 0.1 % ointment under a mask ) with emollient ( petrolatum 20 % in cetomacrogol cream ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was improvement of the objective SCORAD ; secondary outcomes included Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure and quality-of-life index .
RESULTS	WWT with diluted corticosteroids acted faster and was more efficacious than WWT with emollients .
RESULTS	Best results were obtained in age groups 6 to 9 years and 0 to 3 years .
RESULTS	The difference in efficacy evaluated by objective SCORAD was significant at all measuring points .
RESULTS	This also applied to the quality-of-life index .
CONCLUSIONS	The study group was relatively small .
CONCLUSIONS	WWT for severe AD is an effective therapy option for at least a period of 4 weeks .

BACKGROUND	The common variants in the fat mass and obesity-associated ( FTO ) gene have been associated with obesity and insulin resistance .
BACKGROUND	Recently , studies also linked FTO variants with macronutrient intakes .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to investigate whether diet interventions varying in macronutrients modified the effects of FTO genotypes on changes in insulin resistance .
METHODS	We genotyped FTO variants rs1558902 and rs9939609 and measured insulin resistance in fasting plasma samples at baseline and at 6-mo and 2-y visits in 743 overweight or obese adults ( aged 30-70 y , 60 % women ) from a randomized weight-loss dietary interventional trial , the Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies ( POUNDS LOST ) trial .
METHODS	We assessed interactions between FTO variants and intakes of dietary fat and protein in relation to change in body weight and insulin resistance using generalized estimating equation models .
RESULTS	We found significant interactions between rs1558902 and dietary fat on changes in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) and insulin ( P = 0.003 and 0.004 , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Each risk allele ( A ) of rs1558902 showed a trend to be related to a 0.05-unit less reduction in both log ( insulin ) and log ( HOMA-IR ) among the participants assigned to low-fat diets ( both P = 0.06 ) , but this was not significantly related to reduction in those assigned to high-fat diets ( both P > 0.1 ) during the 2-y period of intervention .
RESULTS	Our data showed that the association between rs9939609 and changes in insulin resistance was not modified by diet macronutrient intakes .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results show that carriers of the risk alleles of rs1558902 benefit differently in improving insulin sensitivity by consuming high-fat weight-loss diets rather than low-fat diets .
CONCLUSIONS	Still , given our data , we acknowledge it is difficult to determine whether fat or carbohydrate contributed to the observed associations .

BACKGROUND	The ideal bioptic strategy for CaP detection is still to be completely defined .
BACKGROUND	The aim of our study is to compare transperineal ( TP ) and transrectal ( TR ) approaches , in a 14-core initial prostate biopsy for CaP detection .
METHODS	A prospective controlled study was conducted enrolling 108 consecutive patients with a PSA level greater than 4 ng/mL and/or an abnormal DRE .
METHODS	TR versus TP 14-core initial prostatic biopsies were performed on 54 and 54 patients , respectively , with a randomisation ratio of 1:1 .
RESULTS	The cancer detection rates were 46.29 ( 25 out of 54 patients ) , and 44.44 % ( 24 out of 54 patients ) , respectively , using the TR or the TP approach ( p = 0.846 ) .
RESULTS	The overall cancer core rate was significantly higher when the TP approach was used : 21.43 % ( 162 out of 756 cores ) and 16.79 % ( 127 out of 756 cores ) , with the TP and the TR approach , respectively ( p = 0.022 ) .
RESULTS	The cores were significantly longer performing TP approach : at the site `` 1 '' ( 14.92 versus 12.97 mm , p = 0.02 ) ; at `` 5 '' ( 15.53 versus 13.69 mm , p = 0.037 ) ; at `` 7 '' ( 15.06 versus 12.86 mm , p = 0.001 ) ; at `` 9 '' ( 14.92 versus 13.38 mm , p = 0.038 ) ; at `` 11 '' ( 16.32 versus 12.31 mm , p = 0.0001 ) ; at `` 12 '' ( 15.14 versus 12.19 mm , p = 0.0001 ) ; at `` 13 '' ( 17.49 versus 13.98 mm , p = 0.0001 ) ; at `` 14 '' ( 16.77 versus 13.36 mm , p = 0.0001 ) .
RESULTS	As to the biopsy related pain , the mean pain level perceived by patients during the TR approach was 1.56 1.73 versus 1.42 1.37 registered during TP approach ( p = 0.591 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	No significant differences were found in cancer detection rate , cancer core rate between TP and TR approaches for prostatic biopsy .
CONCLUSIONS	Even in terms of complication rate or pain level , it can not be concluded that one procedure is superior to the other one .
CONCLUSIONS	Apparently , strictly following our protocol , TP approach seems to offer a better sampling at the level of the apex and the TZ , however without adding any significant advantage in terms of overall cancer detection rate .

BACKGROUND	The role of patient age in the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) therapy in ischemic cardiomyopathy ( ICM ) is controversial .
OBJECTIVE	This study sought to determine whether the therapeutic effect of culture-expanded MSCs persists , even in older subjects .
METHODS	Patients with ICM who received MSCs via transendocardial stem cell injection ( TESI ) as part of the TAC-HFT ( Transendocardial Autologous Cells in Ischemic Heart Failure ) ( n = 19 ) and POSEIDON ( Percutaneous Stem Cell Injection Delivery Effects on Neomyogenesis ) ( n = 30 ) clinical trials were divided into 2 age groups : younger than 60 and 60 years of age and older .
METHODS	Functional capacity was measured by 6-min walk distance ( 6MWD ) and quality of life using the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire ( MLHFQ ) score , measured at baseline , 6 months , and 1 year post-TESI .
METHODS	Various cardiac imaging parameters , including absolute scar size , were compared at baseline and 1 year post-TESI .
RESULTS	The mean 6MWD was similar at baseline and increased at 1 year post-TESI in both groups : 48.5 14.6 m ( p = 0.001 ) for the younger and 35.9 18.3 m ( p = 0.038 ) for the older participants ( p = NS between groups ) .
RESULTS	The older group exhibited a significant reduction in MLHFQ score ( -7.04 3.54 ; p = 0.022 ) , whereas the younger than 60 age group had a borderline significant reduction ( -11.22 5.24 ; p = 0.058 ) from baseline ( p = NS between groups ) .
RESULTS	Although there were significant reductions in absolute scar size from baseline to 1 year post-TESI , the effect did not differ by age .
CONCLUSIONS	MSC therapy with TESI in ICM patients improves 6MWD and MLHFQ score and reduces myocardial infarction size .
CONCLUSIONS	Importantly , older individuals did not have an impaired response to MSC therapy .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the intraoperative pain , anxiety , undesired movement , and cooperation between patients receiving oral diazepam or intravenous ( IV ) midazolam for conscious sedation during cataract surgery under topical anesthesia .
METHODS	Ambulatory surgical center , Honolulu , Hawaii , USA .
METHODS	Prospective randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Patients having first-time cataract extraction with topical anesthesia were randomized to receive sedation with oral diazepam 30 minutes before surgery or IV midazolam immediately preceding surgery .
METHODS	The outcomes of intraoperative pain , anxiety , undesired movement , and poor cooperation were observed by the surgeon and recorded during surgery .
RESULTS	One hundred fifty-six cataract surgeries were included , 83 in the IV midazolam group and 73 in the oral diazepam group .
RESULTS	Twenty-four patients ( 29 % ) in the IV group and 7 patients ( 10 % ) in the oral group showed undesired movement ( P < .02 ) .
RESULTS	Seven patients ( 8 % ) in the IV group and 2 patients ( 3 % ) in the oral group showed poor cooperation ( P > .05 ) .
RESULTS	Fifteen patients ( 18 % ) in the IV group and 9 patients ( 12 % ) in the oral group had anxiety ( P > .05 ) .
RESULTS	Three patients ( 4 % ) in the IV group and 3 patients ( 4 % ) in the oral group experienced pain ( P > .05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Fewer patients receiving oral diazepam 30 minutes before cataract surgery than patients receiving IV midazolam immediately preceding surgery showed undesired movement during surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients showing poor cooperation or experiencing pain or anxiety between the 2 groups .
BACKGROUND	No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy of 1-stage versus 2-stage lateral maxillary sinus lift procedures .
METHODS	Sixty partially edentulous patients requiring 1 to 3 implants and having 1 to 3 mm of residual bone height and at least 5 mm bone width below the maxillary sinus , as measured on CT scans were selected .
METHODS	They were randomised according to a parallel group study design into two equal arms to receive either a 1-stage lateral window sinus lift with simultaneous implant placement or a 2-stage procedure with implant placement delayed by 4 months , using a bone substitute in three different centres .
METHODS	Implants were submerged for 4 months , loaded with reinforced provisional prostheses , which were replaced , after 4 months , by definitive prostheses .
METHODS	Outcome measures , assessed by masked assessors , were : augmentation procedure failures ; prosthesis failures and implant failures ; complications ; and marginal peri-implant bone level changes .
METHODS	Patients were followed up to 1 year after loading .
METHODS	Only data of implants placed in 1 to 3 mm of bone height were reported .
RESULTS	Two patients dropped out from the 1-stage group and none from the 2-stage group .
RESULTS	No sinus lift procedure failed in the 1-stage group but one failed in the 2-stage group , the difference being not statistically significant ( P = 1.00 ) .
RESULTS	Two prostheses failed or could not be placed in the planned time in the 1-stage group and one in the 2-stage group , the difference being not statistically significant ( P = 0.51 ) .
RESULTS	Three implants failed in three patients of the 1-stage group , versus one implant in the 2-stage group , the difference being not statistically significant ( P = 0.28 ) .
RESULTS	Two complications occurred in the 1-stage group and one in the 2-stage group , the difference being not statistically significant ( P = 0.61 ) .
RESULTS	One year after loading , 1-stage treated patients lost an average of -1.01 mm ( SD : 0.56 ) of peri-implant bone and 2-stage sites about -0.93 mm ( SD : 0.40 ) .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences in bone level change between groups 1 year after loading ( -0.08 mm 95 % CI : -0.33 to 0.18 P = 0.56 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	No statistically significant differences were observed between implants placed according to 1 - or 2-stage sinus lift procedures .
CONCLUSIONS	However this study may suggest that in patients having residual bone height between 1 to 3 mm below the maxillary sinus , there might be a slightly higher risk for implant failures when performing a 1-stage lateral sinus lift procedure .

OBJECTIVE	The main aim was to investigate the effectiveness of a novel internal teat sealant ( ITS ) formulation containing bismuth subnitrate and the antiseptic chlorhexidine , in adult cows ( Trial A ) and nulliparous heifers ( Trial B ) , to reduce the incidence of new intramammary infection ( IMI ) between treatment and calving and reduce the prevalence of IMI within 6 days following calving .
METHODS	In Trial A dairy cows ( n = 326 ) without history of clinical mastitis and with a maximum composite milk somatic cell count < 200,000 cells/mL during the current lactation were enrolled from three spring-calving mainly pasture-based herds immediately following the final milking .
METHODS	In Trial B all heifers ( n = 166 ) were enrolled from two herds approximately 3 weeks before the start of calving .
METHODS	Glands were randomly assigned to controls or treatment with ITS , and mammary secretion samples were taken from all glands prior to treatment , and on two occasions 0-4 and 3-6 days post-calving to determine the incidence of new IMI and the prevalence of IMI immediately post-calving .
METHODS	Additionally , cows in Trial A were monitored for cases of clinical mastitis ( CM ) in the non-lactating period and animals in both trials were monitored for cases of CM within 30 days of calving .
RESULTS	The ITS reduced the estimated incidence of new IMI with both major and any pathogens compared to control glands in cows ( 6.2 vs. 14.2 % and 14.7 vs. 32.8 % , respectively ) and in heifers ( 3.0 vs. 13.1 % and 13.4 vs. 25.3 % , respectively ) ( p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	The ITS reduced the estimated prevalence of a major or any pathogen compared to untreated controls at both 0-4 and 3-6 days post-calving , in both cows and heifers .
RESULTS	Additionally , the ITS reduced the incidence of CM in the non-lactating period in cows ( -1.0 % , p = 0.01 ) and in the 30 days following calving in heifers ( -2.0 % , p = 0.06 ) , and tended to reduce the estimated incidence of CM in cows post-calving ( -1.7 % , p = 0.10 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The novel ITS reduced the incidence of new IMI , and the prevalence of IMI at calving in both adult cows and heifers , and reduced the incidence of CM in the non-lactating period of cows and in the first 30 days after calving in heifers .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of these trials demonstrate the efficacy of a novel ITS for the control of mastitis in likely uninfected dairy cows over the non-lactating period and in heifers in late pregnancy .

BACKGROUND	We report the results of a phase II trial of adding the anti-ascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) bevacizumab to gemcitabine neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with borderline and unresectable non-metastatic pancreatic cancer .
METHODS	Patients were assigned to one of the two treatment arms .
METHODS	Both groups received 1,000 mg/m ( 2 ) gemcitabine on days 1 , 8 , and 15 of a 4-week cycle for a total of four cycles .
METHODS	Group 1 received 5 mg/kg bevacizumab for six weeks ( three doses ) , every second week , starting at week 6 of gemcitabine therapy .
METHODS	Group 2 received 5 mg/kg bevacizumab for 12 weeks ( six doses ) , every second week , starting at week 1 of gemcitabine therapy .
METHODS	The objective of the present study was to assess the rate of complete radical resection and overall survival .
RESULTS	A total of 30 patients were enrolled : 19 patients had unresectable and 11 patients had borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer .
RESULTS	Eleven patients ( 37 % ) underwent resection .
RESULTS	The median overall survival of patients who underwent tumor resection was 13 months ( 95 % confidence interval = 11-15 months ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In general , adding bevacizumab to neoadjuvant gemcitabine does not improve outcomes for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	However , in individual cases , surgery is consequently possible and prolonged survival may be observed .

BACKGROUND	Heavy drinking poses significant risks to the health and survival of individuals infected with HIV , particularly those coinfected with hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) .
BACKGROUND	However , little is known about patients ' perceptions of these risks , and whether these perceptions relate to their alcohol consumption .
METHODS	A sample of 254 heavily drinking HIV primary care patients ( 78 % male ; 94.5 % minority ; 31.8 % with HCV ) reported on their perceptions of the medical risks of drinking and on their alcohol consumption prior to participation in a drinking-reduction intervention trial .
RESULTS	In the HIV-infected sample as a whole , 62.9 % reported that they had a medical problem made worse by drinking , and 64.3 % reported restricting drinking to avoid future medical problems .
RESULTS	Although patients coinfected with HIV/HCV reported greater efforts to restrict drinking to avoid future medical problems ( adjusted odds ratio = 1.94 ) , their reported drinking quantity and frequency did not differ from that of HIV mono-infected patients .
RESULTS	Awareness of medical risk was not associated with drinking level .
RESULTS	Effort to restrict drinking to avoid medical risk was associated with lower drinking quantity , frequency , and binge frequency ( ps < 0.05 ) , but the association with binge frequency was specific to patients without HCV .
CONCLUSIONS	Over one-third of HIV patients are unaware of the medical risks of drinking , and do not restrict use , suggesting the need for intervention in this group .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients coinfected with HIV/HCV may report more effort to restrict drinking , but their reported drinking quantity and frequency suggest that they are actually drinking just as heavily as HIV mono-infected patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Awareness of medical risk was unrelated to drinking , which suggests the need for interventions consisting of more than simple education .
CONCLUSIONS	However , reported effort to restrict drinking did predict less drinking , suggesting the importance of patient commitment and initiative in change .

OBJECTIVE	In a nonclinical trial setting , we sought to determine the proportion of individuals with coronary artery disease ( CAD ) with optimal risk factor levels based on the COURAGE ( Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive DruG Evaluation ) trial .
BACKGROUND	In the COURAGE trial , the addition of percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) to optimal medical therapy did not reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction in stable CAD patients but resulted in more revascularization procedures .
METHODS	The REGARDS ( REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ) study is a national prospective cohort study of 30,239 African-American and white community-dwelling individuals older than 45 years of age who enrolled in 2003 through 2007 .
METHODS	We calculated the proportion of 3,167 participants with self-reported CAD meeting 7 risk factor goals based on the COURAGE trial : 1 ) aspirin use ; 2 ) systolic blood pressure < 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < 85 mm Hg ( < 80 mm Hg if diabetic ) ; 3 ) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 85 mg/dl , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol > 40 mg/dl , and triglycerides < 150 mg/dl ; 4 ) fasting glucose < 126 mg/dl ; 5 ) nonsmoking status ; 6 ) body mass index < 25 kg/m ( 2 ) ; and 7 ) exercise4 days per week .
RESULTS	The mean age of participants was 69 9 years ; 33 % were African American and 35 % were female .
RESULTS	Overall , the median number of goals met was 4 .
RESULTS	Less than one-fourth met5 of the 7 goals , and 16 % metall 3 goals for aspirin , blood pressure , and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol .
RESULTS	Older age , white race , higher income , more education , and higher physical functioning were independently associated with meeting more goals .
CONCLUSIONS	There is substantial room for improvement in risk factor reduction among U.S. individuals with CAD .

OBJECTIVE	This trial examined diaries of hot flash events reported upon occurrence to assess the test/retest reliability of the diaries and their ability to measure treatment effects on hot flash frequency and severity .
METHODS	Forty-two postmenopausal women ( aged 40 y ; 5-50 hot flashes/wk ) were randomized ( 3:3:1 ) to placebo , raloxifene 60 mg , or paroxetine 20 mg daily for 12 weeks .
METHODS	Diaries of hot flash frequency and severity were evaluated at 1-week intervals ( twice before study treatment and thrice during study treatment ) .
RESULTS	Forty-one women were evaluated .
RESULTS	Baseline characteristics were similar between groups ( eg , mean , 29.8 hot flashes/wk ) .
RESULTS	Concordance correlation coefficients between screening ( week -2 ) and baseline ( week -1 ) measures of hot flash frequency and severity were 0.73 and 0.71 , respectively .
RESULTS	After 12 weeks , the mean ( 95 % CI ) percent changes from baseline in weekly hot flash frequency were as follows : placebo , -37.4 % ( -60.9 to -14.0 ) ; raloxifene , -14.2 % ( -37.7 to 9.3 ) ; paroxetine , -49.8 % ( -88.6 to -11.0 ) ; the mean ( 95 % CI ) percent changes in hot flash severity were as follows : placebo , -39.9 % ( -69.1 to -10.8 ) ; raloxifene , -9.6 % ( -38.8 to 19.6 ) ; paroxetine , -36.6 % ( -84.7 to 11.5 ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in hot flash diary results between treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Measures of hot flash frequency and severity show acceptable test/retest reliability between screening and baseline .
CONCLUSIONS	Reductions in vasomotor symptoms by raloxifene are numerically less than those seen with placebo , but no statistically significant treatment differences have been documented in this small study .
CONCLUSIONS	The large effect of placebo and the significant reduction in vasomotor symptoms by paroxetine are consistent with other studies .
CONCLUSIONS	The diary seems to be suitable for use in hot flash clinical trials .

BACKGROUND	We present a long-term safety , immunogenicity , and effectiveness study of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus ( HPV4 ) vaccine .
METHODS	Sexually naive boys and girls aged 9 to 15 years ( N = 1781 ) were assigned ( 2:1 ) to receive HPV4 vaccine or saline placebo at day 1 and months 2 and 6 .
METHODS	At month 30 , the placebo group ( n = 482 ) received HPV4 vaccine following the same regimen and both cohorts were followed through month 96 .
METHODS	Subjects 16 years were eligible for effectiveness evaluations .
METHODS	The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term anti-HPV6 / 11/16/18 serological levels .
METHODS	The secondary objective was to estimate vaccine effectiveness against HPV6/11/16 / 18-related persistent infection or disease .
RESULTS	For each of the HPV4 vaccine types , vaccination-induced anti-HPV response persisted through month 96 .
RESULTS	Among 429 subjects who received HPV4 vaccine at a mean age of 12 , none developed HPV6/11/16 / 18-related disease or persistent infection of 12 months ' duration .
RESULTS	Acquisition of new sexual partners ( among those 16 years ) was 1 per year .
RESULTS	Subjects receiving HPV4 vaccine at month 30 ( mean age 15 years ) had a similar baseline rate of seropositivity to 1 of the 4 HPV types to those vaccinated at day 1 ( mean age 12 years ; 1.9 % [ 9 of 474 ] vs 1.7 % [ 20 of 1157 ] ) ; however , 4 of the 9 subjects vaccinated at the later age were seropositive to 3 vaccine types , indicating previous HPV exposure .
RESULTS	No new significant serious adverse events were observed for 8 years postvaccination in both genders .
CONCLUSIONS	When administered to adolescents , the HPV4 vaccine demonstrated durability in clinically effective protection and sustained antibody titers over 8 years .

BACKGROUND	A strong association exists between the use of tamsulosin and the occurance of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome .
BACKGROUND	Several methods were advocated to overcome the progressive intraopertive miosis.Our purpose was to investigate the effect of a mydriatic-cocktail soaked cellulose sponge on perioperative pupil diameter in tamsulosin-treated patients undergoing elective cataract surgery .
METHODS	Patients using tamsulosin were dilated either with mydriatic-cocktail soaked sponge ( group 1 ) or with conventional eyedrop regimen ( group 2 ) .
METHODS	Control patients not taking any 1 adrenergic receptor inhibtors were also dilated with mydriatic sponge ( group 3 ) .
METHODS	In all groups oxybuprocain 0.4 % , cocain 4 % , tropicamide 1 % , phenylephrine 10 % , diclophenac 0.1 % along with chloramphenicol 0.5 % were used preoperatively.Pupil diameter ( mm ) was measured preoperatively , after nucleus delivery , and before IOL implantation .
METHODS	Adverse effects associated with the use of sponge , minor and major intraoperative complications , the use of iris retractors and operation time were recorded.Differences in general between groups were analyzed with a one way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) ; differences between groups in proportions were assessed by Fisher 's exact test .
RESULTS	Mean pupil diameter ( mm ) was preopertively : 7.52 1.21 , 7.30 1.55 and 7.99 0.96 ( ANOVA : p = 0.079 ) ; after nucleus delivery : 6 1.20 , 6.29 1.12 and 6.52 0.81 ( ANOVA : p = 0.123 ) ; before IOL implantation : 5.46 1.06 , 5.83 1.09 and 6.17 0.89 ( ANOVA : p = 0.0291 ) .
RESULTS	No adverse effect related to sponge use was detected .
RESULTS	Frequency of minor complications , and iris hook use was similar in the two tamsulosin treated group .
RESULTS	Operation time did not differ significantly in the three groups .
CONCLUSIONS	We have found that using a mydriatic cocktail-soaked wick - an alternative way to achieve intraoperative mydriasis for cataract surgery - was as effective and safe as the conventional repeated eyedrops regiment for tamsulosin treated patients .

OBJECTIVE	Gastroparesis remains a challenging syndrome to manage , with few effective treatments and a lack of rigorously controlled trials .
OBJECTIVE	Tricyclic antidepressants are often used to treat refractory symptoms of nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain .
OBJECTIVE	Evidence from well-designed studies for this use is lacking .
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether treatment with nortriptyline results in symptomatic improvement in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis .
METHODS	The NORIG ( Nortriptyline for Idiopathic Gastroparesis ) trial , a 15-week multicenter , parallel-group , placebo-controlled , double-masked , randomized clinical trial from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium ( GpCRC ) , comparing nortriptyline with placebo for symptomatic relief in idiopathic gastroparesis .
METHODS	One hundred thirty patients with idiopathic gastroparesis were enrolled between March 2009 and June 2012 at 7 US academic medical centers .
METHODS	Patient follow-up was completed in October 2012 .
METHODS	Inclusion criteria included delayed gastric emptying and moderate to severe symptom scores using the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index ( GCSI ) .
METHODS	INTERVENTIONS Nortriptyline vs placebo .
METHODS	Study drug dose was increased at 3-week intervals ( 10 , 25 , 50 , 75 mg ) up to 75 mg at 12 weeks .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure of symptomatic improvement was a decrease from the patient 's baseline GCSI score of at least 50 % on 2 consecutive 3-week GCSI assessments during 15 weeks of treatment .
RESULTS	The primary symptomatic improvement outcome did not differ between 65 patients randomized to nortriptyline vs 65 patients randomized to placebo : 15 ( 23 % [ 95 % CI , 14 % -35 % ] ) in the nortriptyline group vs 14 ( 21 % [ 95 % CI , 12 % -34 % ] ) in the placebo group ( P = .86 ) .
RESULTS	Treatment was stopped more often in the nortriptyline group ( 19 [ 29 % { 95 % CI , 19 % -42 % } ] ) than in the placebo group ( 6 [ 9 % ] { 95 % CI , 3 % -19 % } ] ) ( P = .007 ) , but numbers of adverse events were not different ( 27 [ 95 % CI , 18-39 ] vs 28 [ 95 % CI , 19-40 ] ) ( P = .89 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Among patients with idiopathic gastroparesis , the use of nortriptyline compared with placebo for 15 weeks did not result in improvement in overall symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings do not support the use of nortriptyline for idiopathic gastroparesis .

###26321103
BACKGROUND	Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that cyclosporine may attenuate reperfusion injury and reduce myocardial infarct size .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to test whether cyclosporine would improve clinical outcomes and prevent adverse left ventricular remodeling .
METHODS	In a multicenter , double-blind , randomized trial , we assigned 970 patients with an acute anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) who were undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) within 12 hours after symptom onset and who had complete occlusion of the culprit coronary artery to receive a bolus injection of cyclosporine ( administered intravenously at a dose of 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight ) or matching placebo before coronary recanalization .
METHODS	The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause , worsening of heart failure during the initial hospitalization , rehospitalization for heart failure , or adverse left ventricular remodeling at 1 year .
METHODS	Adverse left ventricular remodeling was defined as an increase of 15 % or more in the left ventricular end-diastolic volume .
RESULTS	A total of 395 patients in the cyclosporine group and 396 in the placebo group received the assigned study drug and had data that could be evaluated for the primary outcome at 1 year .
RESULTS	The rate of the primary outcome was 59.0 % in the cyclosporine group and 58.1 % in the control group ( odds ratio , 1.04 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.78 to 1.39 ; P = 0.77 ) .
RESULTS	Cyclosporine did not reduce the incidence of the separate clinical components of the primary outcome or other events , including recurrent infarction , unstable angina , and stroke .
RESULTS	No significant difference in the safety profile was observed between the two treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with anterior STEMI who had been referred for primary PCI , intravenous cyclosporine did not result in better clinical outcomes than those with placebo and did not prevent adverse left ventricular remodeling at 1 year .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effects of acute and daily consumption of high-oleic peanuts ( HOP ) on inflammation and glucose homeostasis in overweight/obese men .
METHODS	In a 4-week randomized clinical trial , males with body mass index of 29.8 2.3 kg/m ( 2 ) and aged 18-50 years were assigned to the groups : control ( CT , n = 22 ) ; conventional peanuts ( CVP , n = 22 ) ; or HOP ( n = 21 ) .
METHODS	They followed a hypocaloric-diet with or without 56 g/day of CVP or HOP .
METHODS	Main outcomes were changes in fasting blood biomarkers and postprandial insulin , glucose , tumor necrosis factor-alfa ( TNF - ) , and interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) responses after acute peanut intake .
RESULTS	At baseline , HOP showed significantly lower postprandial responses of glucose , insulin , and TNF - than CVP and CT. .
RESULTS	Changes in fasting blood biomarkers did not differ between groups after the 4-week intervention .
RESULTS	However , within groups , total cholesterol decreased in CT , and all groups reduced High-density lipoprotein ( HDL-c ) .
RESULTS	Triglycerides were reduced in HOP and CVP .
RESULTS	IL-10 increased significantly in all groups while only the CT and CVP showed increased TNF - after intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	Acute high-oleic peanut consumption leads to stronger moderation of postprandial glucose , insulin , and TNF - concentrations than CVP and control meal intake .
CONCLUSIONS	Whether daily intake of high-oleic peanuts has additional benefits to CVP remains uncertain .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the safety and efficacy of urinary kallidinogenase for recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) intravenous thrombolytic treatment in patients with acute cerebral infarction .
METHODS	All 200 patients with acute cerebral infarction were randomized 1:1 into an experimental group ( 100 cases ) and a control group ( 100 cases ) .
METHODS	Patients in the control group were administrated rt-PA ( 0/9 mg/kg ) while patients in the experimental group were given urinary kallidinogenase by intravenous drip ( 0.15 PNAU/d , for 7 days ) after rt-PA intravenous thrombolytic treatment ( 0.9 mg/kg ) .
METHODS	The main evaluation index was NIHSS and BI .
RESULTS	Compared to the control group , the NIHSS scores were significantly lower 7 and 90 days after thrombolytic therapy ( t = 2.391 , 2.714 ; p < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	BI scores were obviously higher at 90 days after thrombolytic therapy in the experimental group ( t = 2.675 , p < 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Urinary kallidinogenase may improve the treatment effect for rt-PA intravenous thrombolytic treatment in patients with acute cerebral infraction .

###24903347
OBJECTIVE	To assess the impact of dutasteride compared with placebo on nocturia in men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia , using pooled data from dutasteride phase III studies .
METHODS	Nocturia was assessed using Question 7 of the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire .
METHODS	Efficacy measures included : mean change in nocturia at 24 months ; proportion of patients with improvement/worsening in nocturia ; nocturnal voiding frequency at baseline and study end , overall and by baseline subgroups ; and nocturnal voiding frequency < 2 at study end in patients with baseline score 2 .
RESULTS	In total , 4,321 patients with a mean age of 66 years were evaluated .
RESULTS	From month 12 onwards , mean nocturia improvements were significantly superior with dutasteride than with placebo ( p 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	Reduction in nocturia was significantly better with dutasteride than with placebo across all baseline subgroups tested ( p 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	Also at month 24 , dutasteride therapy resulted in a greater proportion of subjects with nocturia improvement compared with placebo ( p 0.05 ) , with the largest treatment group differences in subjects with a baseline nocturia score of 2 or 3 .
RESULTS	Among patients with significant nocturia at baseline ( score 2 ) , significantly more subjects with dutasteride versus placebo had a score < 2 at month 24 ( 26 vs. 19 % , p < 0.001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	After 24 months of treatment , dutasteride treatment provided significantly greater improvements in nocturia , and less worsening , compared with placebo , primarily in subjects with two or three nocturia episodes per night .
CONCLUSIONS	Studies specifically designed to assess nocturia are required to prospectively confirm these findings .

BACKGROUND	There is increasing interest in the extraskeletal effects of vitamin D , particularly in the obese state with regard to the development of insulin resistance and diabetes .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of the study was to determine the effect of 2 doses of cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) supplementation on insulin action ( Si ) and pancreatic - cell function in obese adolescents .
METHODS	We performed a 12-wk double-blind , randomized comparison of the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on Si and - cell function in obese Caucasian adolescents ( body mass index > 95 ( th ) percentile ) .
METHODS	The subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 400 IU/d ( n = 25 ) or 2000 IU/d ( n = 26 ) of vitamin D3 .
METHODS	Each subject underwent a 7-sample 75 g oral glucose tolerance test , with glucose , insulin , and C-peptide measurements , to calculate Si and - cell function as assessed by the disposition index ( DI ) , with use of the oral minimal model before and after supplementation .
METHODS	A total of 51 subjects aged 15.0 1.9 y were enrolled .
METHODS	Included for analysis at follow-up were a total of 46 subjects ( 20 male and 26 female adolescents ) , 23 in each group .
RESULTS	Initial serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D ] was 24.0 8.1 g/L .
RESULTS	There was no correlation between 25 ( OH ) D concentrations and Si or DI .
RESULTS	There was a modest but significant increase in 25 ( OH ) D concentration in the 2000 IU/d group ( 3.1 6.5 g/L , P = 0.04 ) but not in the 400 IU/d group ( P = 0.39 ) .
RESULTS	There was no change in Si or DI following vitamin D3 supplementation in either of the treatment groups ( all P > 0.10 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The current study shows no effect from vitamin D3 supplementation , irrespective of its dose , on - cell function or insulin action in obese nondiabetic adolescents with relatively good vitamin D status .
CONCLUSIONS	Whether obese adolescents with vitamin D deficiency and impaired glucose metabolism would respond differently to vitamin D3 supplementation remains unclear and warrants further studies .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00858247 .

BACKGROUND	Gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) is associated with both maternal and offspring adverse effects .
BACKGROUND	The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has recently adopted novel GDM criteria .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to evaluate the former WHO and a simplified version of the new International Association for Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group ( IADPSG ) criteria as to prevalence of and risk factors for GDM in a Nordic Caucasian population .
METHODS	A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was performed in 687 women at 18-22 and 32-36 pregnancy weeks .
METHODS	GDM was defined according to the WHO criteria as fasting plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/L and/or 2-hour plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/L and by a simplified version of the IADPSG criteria as either fasting glucose 5.1 mmol/L and/or 2-h plasma glucose 8.5 mmol/L .
METHODS	One-hour glucose values were not available and were thus not included in the diagnosis of GDM by IADPSG .
METHODS	Prevalence of GDM during pregnancy and risk factors for GDM at 18-22 weeks were studied in retrospect according to each of the two criteria .
RESULTS	The total prevalence of GDM during pregnancy was 6.1 % ( 42/687 ) for the WHO criteria and 7.4 % ( 51/687 ) for the simplified IADPSG criteria .
RESULTS	High maternal age and short stature were independently associated with WHO GDM .
RESULTS	Maternal age , fasting insulin and no regular exercise at 18-22 pregnancy weeks associated with simplified IADPSG GDM .
CONCLUSIONS	Simplified IADPSG criteria moderately increase GDM prevalence compared with the WHO criteria .
CONCLUSIONS	Risk factors for GDM differ with the diagnostic criteria used .

OBJECTIVE	At the doses typically used to treat hypertriacylglycerolemia , fish oil may increase low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol and blood glucose levels .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present study was to verify whether soy could attenuate the effects of fish oil on blood lipids and carbohydrate metabolism in patients with metabolic syndrome .
METHODS	Sixty-five women ( 47.9 9.98 y ) were studied with the use of a parallel , randomized design .
METHODS	The control group maintained the usual diet ; the second group received 29.14 g/d of soy ( kinako ) ; the third group received 3 g/d of fish oil n-3 fatty acids ; and the fourth group received fish oil ( 3 g/d ) and kinako ( 29.14 g/d ) .
METHODS	Assessments were performed at baseline and after 45 and 90 d.
RESULTS	In relation to baseline values , fish oil increased ( P < 0.05 ) total and LDL cholesterol , glucose , insulin , and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance levels after 90 d. Comparisons among groups demonstrated a decrease ( P < 0.05 ) in total cholesterol in the fish oil and kinako group after 90 d as compared with the fish oil group .
RESULTS	LDL cholesterol decreased ( P < 0.01 ) in the kinako group as compared with the fish oil group .
RESULTS	Blood glucose and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance levels decreased after 90 d ( P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 , respectively ) and insulin levels decreased ( P < 0.05 ) after 45 d when the kinako group was compared with the fish oil group .
CONCLUSIONS	The present study showed that kinako moderates the adverse effects of high doses of fish oil on LDL cholesterol , total cholesterol , and glucose metabolism levels .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the relative plaque control efficacy of a marketed 0.454 % stabilized stannous fluoride ( SnF2 ) dentifrice relative to a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice using digital plaque imaging analysis ( DPIA ) .
METHODS	This was a randomized , two-treatment , double-blind , parallel group design study that compared SnF2 and triclosan/copolymer dentifrices over a period of 3 weeks .
METHODS	DPIA was used to capture a digital image of the maxillary and mandibular anterior facial surfaces of 12 teeth and to calculate plaque area coverage .
METHODS	Overnight DPIA images were taken at a baseline visit after which subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups and were required to brush with their assigned dentifrice according to each manufacturer 's instructions .
METHODS	Subjects had DPIA assessments on two separate days at the end of Week 3 .
RESULTS	96 subjects were randomized to treatment .
RESULTS	Plaque area data for 47 subjects per treatment group were compared at Week 3 using ANCOVA .
RESULTS	The SnF2 group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in overnight plaque at Week 3 compared to baseline ( P = 0.002 ) .
RESULTS	The reduction for the triclosan group at Week 3 compared to baseline was not statistically significant ( P = 0.24 ) .
RESULTS	At Week 3 , the SnF2 group demonstrated a 17 % lower adjusted mean for overnight plaque relative to the triclosan group with a mean difference that was statistically significant ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	The Week 3 adjusted mean change from baseline in overnight plaque for the SnF2 group was 3 times greater versus that of the triclosan group ( P < 0.05 ) .

BACKGROUND	The study purpose was to analyze 5-year outcomes in a prospective , randomized trial of alemtuzumab ( ALEM ) versus rabbit antithymocyte globulin ( rATG ) induction in simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation ( SKPT ) .
METHODS	From February 2005 through October 2008 , a total of 46 SKPTs ( 45 portal-enteric drainage ) were prospectively randomized to receive either single-dose ALEM ( 30 mg intraoperatively ) or multiple-dose rATG antibody induction ( starting intraoperatively , minimum of 3 doses administered ) with tacrolimus/mycophenolate and/or steroids .
RESULTS	Of 222 kidney transplant patients enrolled in the study , 46 received SKPTs ; 28 ( 61 % ) received ALEM and 18 ( 39 % ) received rATG induction .
RESULTS	Follow-up ranged from 54 to 98 months ( mean , 69 months ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in 5-year patient ( 82 % ALEM vs 89 % rATG ) , kidney graft ( 79 % ALEM vs 72 % rATG ) , or pancreas graft ( 64 % ALEM vs 56 % rATG ) survival rates .
RESULTS	Death-censored kidney ( 90 % ALEM vs 75 % rATG ) and pancreas ( 71 % ALEM vs 56 % rATG ) graft survival rates were likewise comparable ( both , P = NS ) .
RESULTS	Acute rejection ( 21 % ALEM vs 44 % rATG ; P = .11 ) and major infection ( 39 % ALEM vs 67 % rATG ; P = .13 ) rates were slightly lower in the ALEM group ; cytomegalovirus infections were significantly lower ( 0 % ALEM vs 17 % rATG ; P = .05 ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of late acute rejection was low in both groups .
RESULTS	There were no differences in early pancreas thromboses ( 3.6 % ALEM vs 11 % rATG ) , postoperative bleeding ( 11 % ALEM vs 0 % rATG ) , other surgical complications , or readmissions between groups .
RESULTS	In patients with functioning grafts , 5-year mean serum creatinine ( 1.4 ALEM vs 1.6 mg/dL rATG ) , calculated abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease glomerular filtration rate ( 55 ALEM vs 52 mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) rATG ) , glycosylated hemoglobin ( both 5.4 % ) , and C-peptide ( 2.2 ALEM vs 2.3 ng/mL rATG ) levels were similar .
CONCLUSIONS	Single-dose ALEM and multiple dose rATG induction provided similar medium-term patient , kidney , and pancreas graft function and survival rates .
CONCLUSIONS	ALEM induction may be associated with less acute rejection and major infection over the long term .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the mechanisms by which extended-release nicotinic acid reduces circulating lipoprotein ( a ) concentrations in hypertriglyceridemic patients .
RESULTS	Eight nondiabetic , obese male subjects ( aged 4812 years ; body mass index , 31.21.8 kg/m ( 2 ) ) with hypertriglyceridemia ( triglycerides , 22678 mg/dL ) were enrolled in an 8 week , double blind , placebo-controlled cross-over study .
RESULTS	At the end of each treatment phase , fasted subjects received a 10 mol/L per kg bolus injection of [ 5,5,5 - ( 2 ) H3 ] - l-Leucine immediately followed by constant infusion of [ 5,5,5 - ( 2 ) H3 ] - l-Leucine ( 10 mol L ( -1 ) kg ( -1 ) h ( -1 ) ) for 14 hours , and blood samples were collected .
RESULTS	A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was used to study apolipoprotein ( a ) ( Apo ( a ) ) kinetics .
RESULTS	The fractional catabolic rate of Apo ( a ) was calculated with a single compartmental model using the apolipoprotein B100 ( ApoB100 ) containing very low density lipoprotein tracer enrichment as a precursor pool .
RESULTS	Extended-release nicotinic acid decreased plasma triglycerides ( -46 % ; P = 0.023 ) , raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( +20 % ; P = 0.008 ) , and decreased Apo ( a ) plasma concentrations ( -20 % ; P = 0.008 ) .
RESULTS	Extended-release nicotinic acid also decreased ApoB100 ( 22 % ; P = 0.008 ) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 , -29 % ; P = 0.008 ) plasma concentrations .
RESULTS	Apo ( a ) fractional catabolic rate and production rates were decreased by 37 % ( 0.580.28 versus 0.360.19 pool/d ; P = 0.008 ) and 50 % ( 1.40.8 versus 0.70.4 nmol/kg per day ; P = 0.008 ) , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Extended-release nicotinic acid treatment decreased Apo ( a ) plasma concentrations by 20 % , production rates by 50 % , and catabolism by 37 % .
CONCLUSIONS	ApoB100 and PCSK9 concentrations were also decreased by treatment , but no correlation was found with Apo ( a ) kinetic parameters .

###25141084
OBJECTIVE	We sought to compare the effects of physical practice ( PP ) and mental practice ( MP ) on the immediate and long-term learning of the finger-to-thumb opposition sequence task ( FOS ) in children ; in addition , we investigated the transfer of this learning to an untrained sequence of movements and to the contralateral untrained hand .
METHODS	This study included thirty-six 9 - and 10-year-old children who were randomly allocated into 3 groups : MP , PP , and no practice ( NP ) .
METHODS	The MP and PP groups were subjected to a single session of training with the dominant trained hand .
METHODS	MP participants were trained by mentally rehearsing the movements , PP participants were trained by executing the movements , and the NP group had no training .
METHODS	The performance of the trained sequence ( TS ) and untrained reverse sequence ( URS ) by each of the 3 groups was evaluated under identical conditions before training , after 5 min , and at 4 days , 7 days , and 28 days after training .
RESULTS	Whereas both trained groups ( MP and PP ) showed statistically significant improvement in TS using the trained hand at all assessment points after the training , only MP participants were able to transfer the performance gains from the TS to the URS and from the trained hand to the untrained opposite hand .
CONCLUSIONS	Children were able to learn the FOS through MP or PP with a similar level of performance .
CONCLUSIONS	Unlike PP , MP allowed for the transfer of performance gain to the URS and to the opposite hand , suggesting that the internal representations developed by MP were effector-independent .

BACKGROUND	Renal dysfunction ( RD ) is associated with poor outcome in systolic heart failure ( HF ) .
BACKGROUND	Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) is not depressed to a greater extent in patients with RD compared to patients with normal renal function , but it is relatively unknown whether other measures of myocardial function are impaired by RD. .
BACKGROUND	The objective of the present study is to evaluate whether RD in systolic HF is associated with excessive impairment of myocardial function , evaluated by strain analysis and cardiac biomarkers .
METHODS	Patients with LVEF < 0.45 % were enrolled from an outpatient HF clinic .
METHODS	The patients underwent advanced echocardiography .
METHODS	Glomerular filtration rate was estimated by the CKD-EPI equation ( eGFR ) and patients grouped by eGFR : eGFR group-I , 90 ml/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) ; eGFR group-II , 60-89 ml/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) ; and eGFR group-III , 59 ml/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) .
METHODS	Multivariate regression models were developed to evaluate the associations between eGFR groups , echocardiographic measures and cardiac biomarkers .
RESULTS	A total of 149 patients participated in the study .
RESULTS	Median age was 69 years , 26 % were female ; LVEF was 33 % .
RESULTS	Patients with a low eGFR were older ( P < 0.001 ) , but there were no differences in frequency of atrial fibrillation , hypertension , diabetes and ischemic heart disease between eGFR groups ( P > 0.05 for all ) .
RESULTS	RD was associated with impaired global longitudinal strain ( P = 0.018 ) , increased E/e ' ( P = 0.032 ) , larger left atria ( P = 0.038 ) and increased levels of proANP ( P < 0.001 ) , NT-proBNP ( P < 0.001 ) and troponin I ( P = 0.019 ) after adjustment for traditional confounders .
CONCLUSIONS	Echocardiographic measures and biomarkers reflecting different aspects of myocardial function are impaired in systolic HF patients with RD and the increased mortality risk in these patients may partly be explained by a depressed cardiac function .

BACKGROUND	Previously , in a 40-week , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled core study comprising three phases ( 9-week dose confirmation , 5-week open-label dose optimisation and 6-month maintenance of effect ) in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , methylphenidate modified-release long-acting formulation ( MPH-LA ) at 40-80 mg/day controlled ADHD symptoms as well as decreased functional impairment with a good tolerability profile ( NCT01259492 ) .
BACKGROUND	Here , we report the long-term efficacy and safety from a 26-week , open-label extension phase of the same study ( NCT01338818 ) .
METHODS	Patients in the extension study ( n = 298 ) initiated treatment with MPH-LA ( 20 mg/day ) , up-titrated in increments of 20 mg/week to reach individual patient 's daily optimal dose of 40-80 mg .
METHODS	Adverse events ( AEs ) and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) were reported at the end of extension study for events monitored from ( 1 ) maintenance of effect phase baseline ( core study ; 12 months ) and ( 2 ) extension study baseline ( 6 months ) .
METHODS	Mean changes in DSM-IV ADHD Rating Scale ( DSM-IV ADHD RS ) and Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS ) total scores are reported for both the timelines .
METHODS	Efficacy was also evaluated using clinician-rated instruments , namely Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale ( CGI-I ) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale ( CGI-S ) .
RESULTS	No unexpected AEs were reported in the extension study .
RESULTS	Incidence of SAEs reported during 6 months and 12 months were similar ( 0.7 % ) , and no deaths were reported .
RESULTS	No SAEs were considered attributable to the drug at the end of 12 months .
RESULTS	There were no reports of patients with QT , QTcB or QTcF > 500 ms. The mean improvement in DSM-IV ADHD RS and SDS total scores at the end of 12 months were 0.9 and 1.4 points , respectively ; and at the end of 6 months were 7.2 and 4.8 , respectively .
RESULTS	The proportion of patients with improvement in CGI-S scale was 31.4 % and 52.1 % at the end of 12 and 6 months , respectively .
RESULTS	Overall , 69.4 % of patients showed clinical improvement in CGI-I scale at the end of 6 months .
CONCLUSIONS	In adult patients with ADHD , use of MPH-LA up to 1 year continued to be well tolerated while maintaining the clinical efficacy .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the efficiency of total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) for varus osteoarthritic knees with tibial bone resection determined by lateral tibiofemoral joint 90 flexional gap measurement .
METHODS	Between March and June 2013 , 60 patients ( 60 knees ) with varus osteoarthritic knees underwent TKA .
METHODS	All patients were randomly divided into traditional osteotomy group ( control group , 30 cases ) and lateral tibiofemoral joint 90 flexional gap measurement resection group ( trial group , 30 cases ) .
METHODS	There was no significant difference in gender , age , affected side , body mass index and preoperative knee society score ( KSS ) , range of motion ( ROM ) of the knee , anatomic tibiofemoral angle ( ATFA ) , patellar tilt angle , posterior condylar offset ( PCO ) , and joint line height between 2 groups ( P > 0.05 ) .
METHODS	The bone resection thickness of the distal femoral lateral condyle , femoral posterior lateral condyle , and lateral tibial plateau were measured ; and the X-ray films were taken to measure and compare ATFA , patellar tilt angle , PCO , and joint line height after TKA .
METHODS	The knee function recovery was evaluated with KSS score and ROM of the knee .
RESULTS	The bone resection thickness of the lateral tibial plateau and distal femoral lateral condyle in trial group was significantly smaller than that in control group ( P < 0.05 ) ; while the bone resection thickness of the femoral posterior lateral condyle was significantly bigger than that in control group ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	The 10 mm polyethylene insert was used in 19 cases of the trial group and in 8 cases of the control group , showing significant difference ( Z = -4.040 , P = 0.003 ) .
RESULTS	All the patients were followed up 13-16 months ( mean , 14.5 months ) .
RESULTS	Radiography at 6 weeks after TKA indicated that the ATFA , patellar tilt angle , and joint line height had no significant difference between 2 groups ( P > 0.05 ) ; the PCO of trial group was significantly lower than that of control group ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	The KSS score and ROM of the knee at 12 months after operation were significantly improved when compared with preoperative ones in 2 groups ( P < 0.05 ) , and trial group was significantly better than control group ( P < 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	It was an effective method to determine bone resection thickness using lateral tibiofemoral joint 90 flexional gap measurement in TKA for varus osteoarthritic knees , which can reduce the bone resection thickness of the tibial plateau and distal femoral lateral condyle and restore the joint line and PCO with better early recovery of the knee function .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reduction in bacterial loading uing MTAD as an irrigating solution in pulpectomized primary teeth .
METHODS	A randomized , controlled clinical trial was performed that included primary teeth with pulp necrosis .
METHODS	Sixty necrotic canals were included , 30 irrigated with MTAD ( experimental group ) and 30 with 1 % Na0Cl solution ( control group ) ; in all cases , 2 microbiological samples from within the canals were taken with sterile paper points , the first after the canal opening and before the first irrigation , and the second after instrumentation and final irrigation , before obturation .
METHODS	All samples were evaluated by Agar plate method .
RESULTS	The results were statistically analyzed by student ` t ' test .
RESULTS	After analyzing samples before and after irrigation in the control group ( NaOCl ) , we found a significant decrease of bacterial load ( p = < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	The same occurred in the MTAD group samples ( p = < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	When both groups were compared post irrigation , a statistically significant difference was observed in favor of MTAD .
CONCLUSIONS	MTAD can be suggested as an alternative irrigant for pulpectomy of necrotic teeth .

OBJECTIVE	To describe the imaging standards , grading protocol and baseline characteristics of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy ( PCV ) from the EVEREST study .
METHODS	In a prospective , multicentre study , confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope indocyanine green angiography ( ICGA ) was performed using a standardised imaging protocol .
METHODS	All images were graded using standardised , calibrated equipment by fellowship-trained ophthalmologists at the Central Reading Center .
RESULTS	Sixty-one patients with PCV were included in the study .
RESULTS	ICGA characteristics included : nodular appearance stereoscopically ( 56 eyes , 91.8 % ) , hypofluorescent halo ( 42 , 68.9 % ) , abnormal vascular network ( 54 , 88.5 % ) and pulsation of the polyps ( 4 , 6.6 % ) .
RESULTS	Colour fundus photography revealed orange subretinal nodules ( 34 , 55.7 % ) and massive submacular haemorrhage ( 8 , 13.1 % ) .
RESULTS	The mean area of the PCV lesion was 3.11 mm ( 2 ) ( range , 0.2-10 .7 mm ( 2 ) ) .
RESULTS	The vascular channels filled within 7.3-32 .0 s ( mean : 17.9 s ) while the mean filling time for polyps was 21.9 s ( range , 7.3-40 .4 s ) .
RESULTS	Patients with massive submacular haemorrhage were less likely to have abnormal vascular channels seen on ICGA ( 28.6 % vs 83.3 % for those without massive haemorrhage , p = 0.001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The imaging and grading protocols and baseline characteristics of a multicentre , randomised controlled trial of PCV are described in detail , and may serve as reference for future randomised , controlled trials on PCV .

OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to determine the effect of topical lidocaine on Penetration-Aspiration Scale ( PAS ) scores and patient comfort and tolerance of flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing ( FEES ) examinations in dysphagic patients .
METHODS	Adults with dysphagia referred for swallowing evaluation were recruited to participate in consecutive nonanesthetized and then anesthetized FEES examinations .
METHODS	Under endoscopic visualization , participants consumed 6 swallows consisting of graduated volumes of milk , pudding , and cracker in each condition and recorded their discomfort and tolerance in the 2 conditions .
METHODS	Penetration-Aspiration Scale scores were assigned in blinded fashion for each swallow .
RESULTS	Twenty-five adults participated in the study .
RESULTS	Although there was no statistically significant effect of anesthesia on PAS scores ( P = .065 ) , the odds of a higher PAS score were 33 % higher during anesthetized swallows .
RESULTS	The anesthetized condition yielded significantly less discomfort and pain during the examination , significantly less pain and discomfort during insertion and removal of the endoscope , and significantly greater overall tolerance than the nonanesthetized condition .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of topical lidocaine during FEES may impair swallowing ability in patients with dysphagia , but this result does not achieve statistical significance .
CONCLUSIONS	Topical nasal anesthesia significantly reduces subjective pain and discomfort and improves tolerance during FEES .

OBJECTIVE	A prospective , randomized comparison of shock wave lithotripsy , retrograde intrarenal surgery and miniperc for the treatment of 1 to 2 cm radiolucent lower calyceal renal calculi was done to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these procedures .
METHODS	Patients with a single 1 to 2 cm radiolucent lower calyceal renal stone who underwent treatment between January 2012 and May 2013 were included in study .
METHODS	They were randomized to shock wave lithotripsy , retrograde intrarenal surgery and miniperc groups .
METHODS	Patient demographic profiles , success and re-treatment rates , auxiliary procedures and complications were analyzed .
RESULTS	A total of 45 patients were enrolled in each of the shock wave lithotripsy , retrograde intrarenal surgery and miniperc groups .
RESULTS	Three , 2 and 4 patients , respectively , were excluded from final analysis due to a matrix stone diagnosis .
RESULTS	Mean procedure and fluoroscopy times were significantly greater in the miniperc group than in the other groups .
RESULTS	Hospital stay ( 3.1 days vs 3.1 hours and 1.3 days , p = 0.01 ) and the blood transfusion rate ( 13.3 % vs 0 % and 0 % , p = 0.03 ) were significantly higher for miniperc vs shock wave lithotripsy and retrograde intrarenal surgery , respectively .
RESULTS	The re-treatment rate ( 63.4 % vs 2.1 % and 2.2 % , p < 0.001 ) and the auxiliary procedure rate ( 20.2 % vs 8.8 % and 6.6 % , p = 0.02 ) were significantly greater for shock wave lithotripsy than for retrograde intrarenal surgery and miniperc , respectively .
RESULTS	The 3-month stone-free rate of shock wave lithotripsy , retrograde intrarenal surgery and miniperc was 73.8 % ( 31 of 42 patients ) , 86.1 % ( 37 of 43 ) and 95.1 % ( 39 of 41 ) , respectively ( p = 0.01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Miniperc and retrograde intrarenal surgery were more effective than shock wave lithotripsy to treat 1 to 2 cm radiolucent lower calyceal renal calculi in terms of a better stone-free rate , and lesser auxiliary and re-treatment rates .
CONCLUSIONS	However , miniperc resulted in more complications , greater operative time and radiation exposure , and a longer hospital stay .

BACKGROUND	Blood biomarkers are increasingly used to diagnose , guide therapy in , and risk-stratify community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) patients in emergency departments ( EDs ) .
BACKGROUND	How pre-analytic factors affect these markers ' initial levels in this population is unknown .
METHODS	In this secondary analysis of consecutive ED patients with CAP from a large multicentre antibiotic stewardship trial , we used adjusted multivariate regression models to determine the magnitude and statistical significance of differences in mean baseline concentrations of five biomarkers ( procalcitonin [ PCT ] , C-reactive protein [ CRP ] , white blood cells count [ WBC ] , proadrenomedullin [ ProADM ] , copeptin ) associated with six pre-analytic factors ( antibiotic or corticosteroid pretreatment , age , gender , chronic renal failure or chronic liver insufficiency ) .
RESULTS	Of 925 CAP patients ( median age 73 years , 58.8 % male ) , 25.5 % had antibiotic pretreatment , 2.4 % , corticosteroid pretreatment , 22.3 % , chronic renal failure , 2.4 % chronic liver insufficiency .
RESULTS	Differences associated with pre-analytic factors averaged 6.1 % 4.6 % ; the three largest statistically significant changes ( 95 % confidence interval ) were : PCT , +14.2 % ( +2.1 % to +26.4 % , p = 0.02 ) with liver insufficiency ; ProADM , +13.2 % ( +10.2 % to +16.1 % , p < 0.01 ) with age above median ; CRP , -12.8 % ( -25.4 % to -0.2 % , p = 0.05 ) with steroid pretreatment .
RESULTS	In post hoc sensitivity analyses , reclassification statistics showed that these factors did not result in significant changes of biomarker levels across clinically used cut-off ranges .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite statistically significant associations of some pre-analytic factors and biomarker levels , a clinically relevant influence seems unlikely .
CONCLUSIONS	Our observations reinforce the concept of using biomarkers in algorithms with widely-separated cut-offs and overruling criteria considering the entire clinical picture .

BACKGROUND	Malaria prophylaxis is recommended for persons with sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , but the value of this has been questioned .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to find out whether intermittent preventive treatment ( IPT ) with a fixed-dose combination of mefloquine-artesunate ( MQAS ) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine ( SPAQ ) was more effective than daily proguanil for malaria prevention in subjects with SCD .
METHODS	Patients with SCD were randomized to receive daily treatment with proguanil or IPT with either MQAS or SPAQ once every 2 months at routine clinic visits .
METHODS	Patients were followed up for 14 months .
RESULTS	A total of 270 patients with SCD were studied , with 90 in each group .
RESULTS	Adherence to the IPT regimens was excellent , but 57 % of patients took < 75 % of their daily doses of proguanil .
RESULTS	IPT was well tolerated ; the most common side effects were vomiting and abdominal pain .
RESULTS	Protective efficacy against malaria , compared with daily proguanil , was 61 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 3 % -84 % ) for MQAS and 36 % ( 40 % -70 % ) for SPAQ .
RESULTS	There were fewer outpatient illness episodes in children who received IPT than those who received proguanil .
CONCLUSIONS	IPT with MQAS administered to patients with SCD during routine clinic visits was well tolerated and more effective in preventing malaria than daily prophylaxis with proguanil .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the clinical effectiveness of a newly developed cognitive behavioural self-management manual delivered by specialist heart failure nurses or the same programme followed by the patient on their own , in terms of readmissions/admissions to hospital for any reason within a 12 month period , patient health related quality of life , self-management and carer quality of life .
METHODS	Pragmatic , open parallel group , randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	Open access heart failure diagnostic clinics and primary care .
METHODS	260 patients with a definitive diagnosis of symptomatic heart failure ( LVSD ) as defined by ECHO , clinical diagnosis or coronary angiography were eligible for the study .
METHODS	A newly developed nurse facilitated , cognitive behavioural self-management programme was developed and was delivered either by a heart failure nurse or by the patient on their own .
METHODS	Patient admission/readmission to hospital for any reason within a 12 month period following randomisation .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were : participant health related quality of life as measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire , the Hospital , Anxiety and Depression Scale , the European self-care form .
RESULTS	There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in whether or not a patient was re-admitted to hospital during the 12 month follow-up period ( p = 0.66 ) .
RESULTS	There was no evidence of a difference between the treatment groups in the mean MLHF scores over time ( p = 0.768 ) , the European self-care questionnaire ( p = 0.340 ) or the mean HAD anxiety score ( p = 0.786 ) .
RESULTS	However , when adjusted for baseline scores the self-management group had a statistically significant higher HADS depression score at 12 months ( p = 0.003 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no evidence of a difference in admissions/readmission to hospital between patients who undertook a brief heart failure self-management programme facilitated by a specialist heart failure nurse and those also receiving care from a specialist nurse who followed the programme on their own .
BACKGROUND	This trial is registered as ISRCTN84692046 .

###24768330
OBJECTIVE	For advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour ( GIST ) patients who are responding to imatinib mesylate , the role of surgery has not been formally demonstrated .
OBJECTIVE	This multicenter randomised controlled trial was designed to assess whether surgery to treat residual disease for patients with recurrent/metastatic GISTs responding to imatinib mesylate ( IM ) improved progression free survival ( PFS ) compared with IM treatment alone .
METHODS	Between 3 and 12months after starting IM for recurrent/metastatic GISTs , eligible patients were randomised to two arms : Arm A ( surgery for residual disease ) and Arm B ( IM treatment alone ) .
METHODS	In Arm A ( 19pts ) , surgery was performed to remove residual macroscopic lesions as completely as possible , and IM treatment continued after surgery .
METHODS	In Arm B ( 22pts ) , IM was given alone at a dose of 400mg per day until disease progression .
METHODS	The primary end-point was PFS measured from the date IM started .
METHODS	This study was registered in the ChiCTR registry with the ID number ChiCTR-TRC-00000244 .
RESULTS	This randomised trial was closed early due to poor accrual .
RESULTS	Only 41 patients were enrolled as opposed to 210 patients planned .
RESULTS	2-year PFS was 88.4 % in the surgery arm and 57.7 % in the IM-alone arm ( P = 0.089 ) .
RESULTS	Median overall survival ( mOS ) was not reached in the surgery arm and 49months in patients with IM-alone arm ( P = 0.024 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	While no significant differences were observed in the two arms , this study suggests that surgical removal of the metastatic lesion may improve the outcome of advanced GIST patients and should stimulate additional research on this topic .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to compare the effects of low-volume , high-intensity aerobic interval training ( HAIT ) on maximal oxygen consumption ( VOmax ) , left ventricular ( LV ) mass , and heart rate recovery ( HRR ) with high-volume , moderate-intensity continuous aerobic training ( CAT ) in sedentary adults .
METHODS	Twenty-four healthy but sedentary male adults ( aged 29.2 7.2 years ) participated in an 8-week , 3-day a week , supervised exercise intervention .
METHODS	They were randomly assigned to either HAIT ( 18 min , 180 kcal per exercise session ) or CAT ( 45 min , 360 kcal ) .
METHODS	VOmax , LV mass ( 3T-MRI ) , and HRR at 1 min ( HRR-1 ) and 2 min ( HRR-2 ) after maximal exercise were measured pre - and post-intervention .
RESULTS	Changes in VOmax during the 8-week intervention were significant ( P < 0.01 ) in both groups ( HAIT , 8.7 3.2 ml kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) , 22.4 8.9 % ; CAT , 5.5 2.8 ml kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) , 14.7 9.5 % ) , while the VOmax improvement in HAIT was greater ( P = 0.02 ) than in CAT .
RESULTS	LV mass in HAIT increased ( 5.1 8.4 g , 5.7 9.1 % , P = 0.05 ) , but not in CAT ( 0.9 7.8 g , 1.1 8.4 % , P = 0.71 ) .
RESULTS	While changes in HRR-1 were not significant in either group , change in HRR-2 for HAIT ( 9.5 6.4 bpm , 19.0 16.0 % , P < 0.01 ) was greater ( P = 0.03 ) than for CAT ( 1.6 10.9 bpm , 3.9 16.2 % , P = 0.42 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study suggests that HAIT has potential as a time-efficient training mode to improve cardiorespiratory capacity and autonomic nervous system function in sedentary adults .

###24646343
OBJECTIVE	To investigate short - and long-term effects of real-time monitoring medication use combined with short message service ( SMS ) reminders for missed doses on refill adherence to oral anti-diabetic medication .
METHODS	A randomized controlled trial with two intervention groups and one control group involving 161 participants with Type2 diabetes with suboptimal adherence .
METHODS	For 6months , participants in the SMS group ( n = 56 ) were monitored and received SMS reminders if they missed their medication .
METHODS	Participants in the non-SMS group ( n = 48 ) were only monitored .
METHODS	The control group ( n = 57 ) was not exposed to any intervention .
METHODS	Primary outcome measure was refill adherence to oral anti-diabetic medication .
METHODS	Multi-level regression analyses were performed to examine intervention effects on adherence between and within groups after 1 and 2years of follow-up .
RESULTS	At baseline , mean refill adherence was comparable between the groups .
RESULTS	After 1year , adherence in the SMS group was significantly higher than in the control group ( 79.5 % vs. 64.5 % ; P < 0.001 ) and showed a significant improvement from baseline ( +16.3 % ; P < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	Mean adherence in the non-SMS group reached 73.1 % ( +7.3 % ; P < 0.05 ) , but did not differ from the control group ( P = 0.06 ) .
RESULTS	After 2years , the improved adherence in the SMS group persisted and remained significantly higher than in the control group ( 80.4 % vs. 68.4 % ; P < .01 ) , contrary to the non-SMS group whose adherence approached baseline level again ( 65.5 % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows the long-term effectiveness of real-time medication monitoring combined with SMS reminders in improving refill adherence .
CONCLUSIONS	This new reminder system can strengthen the self-management of people with diabetes .

BACKGROUND	Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , as a common systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease , affects approximately 1 in 100 individuals .
BACKGROUND	Effective treatment for RA is not yet available because current research does not have a clear understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of RA .
BACKGROUND	Xinfeng Capsule , a patent Chinese herbal medicine , has been used in the treatment of RA in recent years .
BACKGROUND	Despite its reported clinical efficacy , there are no large-sample , multicenter , randomized trials that support the use of Xinfeng Capsule for RA .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , we designed a randomized , double-blind , multicenter , placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Xinfeng Capsule in the treatment of RA .
METHODS	This is a 12-week , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , multicenter trial on the treatment of RA .
METHODS	The participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group at a ratio of 1:1 .
METHODS	Participants in the experimental group will receive Xinfeng Capsule and a pharmaceutical placebo ( imitation leflunomide ) .
METHODS	The control group will receive leflunomide and an herbal placebo ( imitation Xinfeng Capsule ) .
METHODS	The American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) Criteria for RA will be used to measure the efficacy of the Xinfeng Capsule .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of study participants who achieve an ACR 20 % response rate ( ACR20 ) , which will be measured every 4 weeks after randomization .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes will include the ACR50 and ACR70 responses , the side effects of the medications , the Disease Activity Score 28 , RA biomarkers , quality of life , and X-rays of the hands and wrists .
METHODS	The first four of the secondary outcomes will be measured every 4 weeks and the others will be measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	The result of this trial will help to evaluate whether Xinfeng Capsule is effective and safe in the treatment of RA .
BACKGROUND	This trial has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov .
BACKGROUND	The identifier is NCT01774877 .

BACKGROUND	Different aspiration techniques to retrieve bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) affect sample quality in healthy dogs .
BACKGROUND	Studies evaluating these techniques in dogs with respiratory disease are lacking .
OBJECTIVE	To compare sample quality of BALF acquired by manual aspiration ( MA ) and suction pump aspiration ( SPA ) .
METHODS	Eighteen client-owned dogs with respiratory disease .
METHODS	Randomized , blinded prospective clinical trial .
METHODS	Manual aspiration was performed with a 35-mL syringe attached directly to the bronchoscope biopsy channel and SPA was performed with a maximum of 50 mmHg negative pressure applied to the bronchoscope suction valve using the suction trap connection .
METHODS	Both aspiration techniques were performed in each dog on contralateral lung lobes , utilizing 2 mL/kg lavage volumes per site .
METHODS	Samples of BALF were analyzed by percentage of retrieved infusate , total nucleated cell count ( TNCC ) , differential cell count , semiquantitative assessment of slide quality , and diagnosis score .
METHODS	Data were compared by paired Student 's t-test , Wilcoxon signed-rank test , chi-squared test , and ANOVA .
METHODS	Cohen 's kappa coefficient was used to assess agreement .
RESULTS	The percentage of retrieved BALF ( P = .001 ) was significantly higher for SPA than MA .
RESULTS	Substantial agreement was found between cytologic classification of BALF obtained with MA and SPA ( kappa = 0.615 ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in rate of definitive diagnosis achieved with cytologic assessment between techniques ( P = .78 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Suction pump aspiration , compared to MA , improved BALF retrieval , but did not significantly affect the rate of diagnostic success of bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) in dogs with pulmonary disease .

BACKGROUND	As a Chinese Traditional Medicine product , Kuntai capsule could improve the peri-menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women .
BACKGROUND	But it is still not clear whether Kuntai capsule has a good effect on alleviating peri-menopausal symptoms induced by gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist ( GnRH-a ) treatment .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness and safety of Kuntai capsule , on peri-menopausal symptoms in endometriosis ( EMS ) patients , with postoperative GnRH-a treatment .
METHODS	Ninety EMS ovarian cyst women with postoperative GnRH-a administration were enrolled in the study , and were randomly divided into Kuntai group , Tibolone group , or blank Control group .
METHODS	The therapeutic strategy in Kuntai group was 4 Kuntai capsules tid , po for 12 weeks after the first GnRH-a injection , while Tibolone 2.5 mg qd , po for 12 weeks in Tibolone group .
METHODS	There was no drug addition in Control group .
METHODS	Climacteric complaints were evaluated by Kupperman menopausal index ( KMI ) and hot flash/sweating score .
METHODS	Liver and renal functions , lipid profile , serum sex hormone levels and endometrial thickness were measured , and the frequency of adverse events in Kuntai and Tibolone groups was recorded .
RESULTS	( 1 ) Before GnRH-a therapy , the baseline parameter results were comparable in the three groups ( P > 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	( 2 ) After GnRH-a therapy , KMI and hot flash/sweating scores in all the three groups increased significantly ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	At the 4 th week after GnRH-a therapy , KMI and hot flash/sweating score results were as follows : Control group > Kuntai group > Tibolone group ( P < 0.05 ) ; at the 8 th and 12 th week after GnRH-a therapy , KMI and hot flash/sweating score in Control group were significantly higher than the other two groups ( P < 0.05 ) , and no significant difference was identified between Kuntai and Tibolone group ( P > 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	( 3 ) No statistical change took place in the liver and renal functions and lipid profile in all the three groups after the treatment ( P > 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	( 4 ) The posttherapeutic serum follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and estradiol ( E2 ) level and endometrial thickness decreased significantly in all the three groups ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	After therapy , serum E2 level in Tibolone group was obviously higher than the other two groups ( P < 0.05 ) , while FSH and LH levels were obviously lower ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	( 5 ) The incidence of vaginal bleeding , breast distending pain in Tibolne group was obviously higher than Kuntai group ( P < 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Kuntai capsule is effective on the peri-menopausal symptoms induced by postoperative GnRH-a administration to EMS patients , although its clinical effect might be a few weeks later than Tibolone .
CONCLUSIONS	Kuntai capsule might be a little safer than Tibolone tablet .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this clinical investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of a marketed whitening chewing gum compared to a no-gum control in preventing the formation of extrinsic stains on the teeth of stain-forming subjects when chewed over a 12-week period of regular unsupervised use in conjunction with daily tooth brushing .
METHODS	This was a single-center , examiner-blind , randomized , 12-week crossover clinical trial .
METHODS	Stain-forming ( after smoking or drinking coffee or tea ) adults , starting with a stain-free baseline , either chewed the test gum ( Orbit White ) unsupervised four times per day , 15 minutes/chew , or used no gum along with daily brushing with a commercially available toothbrush and dentifrice for 12 weeks .
METHODS	At the crossover , all procedures were repeated with subjects assigned the opposite treatment .
METHODS	Extrinsic stain was measured at six and 12 weeks by both the Lobene Stain Index ( LSI ) and the Modified Lobene Stain Index ( MLSI ) using separate experienced examiners .
RESULTS	After 12 weeks , LSI stain scores showed a significant 25 % reduction ( p = 0.0008 ) in new stain formation for subjects using the test chewing gum along with tooth brushing versus tooth brushing alone ( no-gum control ) .
RESULTS	The corresponding MLSI stain scores demonstrated a 36 % reduction ( p < 0.0001 ) in the formation of extrinsic stain on the teeth .
CONCLUSIONS	The overall findings of this clinical study demonstrated that regular use of Orbit White chewing gum , soon after smoking or drinking coffee or tea , will supplement daily tooth brushing in preventing unsightly stains from forming on the anterior teeth compared to brushing alone .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of mindfulness meditation for the treatment of chronic insomnia .
METHODS	Three-arm , single-site , randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Academic medical center .
METHODS	Fifty-four adults with chronic insomnia .
METHODS	Participants were randomized to either mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia ( MBTI ) , or an eight-week self-monitoring ( SM ) condition .
RESULTS	Patient-reported outcome measures were total wake time ( TWT ) from sleep diaries , the pre-sleep arousal scale ( PSAS ) , measuring a prominent waking correlate of insomnia , and the Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) to determine remission and response as clinical endpoints .
RESULTS	Objective sleep measures were derived from laboratory polysomnography and wrist actigraphy .
RESULTS	Linear mixed models showed that those receiving a meditation-based intervention ( MBSR or MBTI ) had significantly greater reductions on TWT minutes ( 43.75 vs 1.09 ) , PSAS ( 7.13 vs 0.16 ) , and ISI ( 4.56 vs 0.06 ) from baseline-to-post compared to SM .
RESULTS	Post hoc analyses revealed that each intervention was superior to SM on each of the patient-reported measures , but no significant differences were found when comparing MBSR to MBTI from baseline-to-post .
RESULTS	From baseline to 6-month follow-up , MBTI had greater reductions in ISI scores than MBSR ( P < 0.05 ) , with the largest difference occurring at the 3-month follow-up .
RESULTS	Remission and response rates in MBTI and MBSR were sustained from post-treatment through follow-up , with MBTI showing the highest rates of treatment remission ( 50 % ) and response ( 78.6 % ) at the 6-month follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	Mindfulness meditation appears to be a viable treatment option for adults with chronic insomnia and could provide an alternative to traditional treatments for insomnia .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the effect of nurse-implemented transitional care ( TC ) on readmission and mortality rates in Chinese individuals with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) in Hong Kong .
METHODS	Single-center randomized controlled trial of TC versus usual care ( UC ) .
METHODS	University-affiliated hospital in Hong Kong .
METHODS	Hospitalized Chinese individuals with CHF ( N = 178 ; aged 78.6 6.9 , 45 % male ) .
METHODS	The TC group received a predischarge visit , two home visits , and then regular telephone calls over 9 months to provide self-care education and support , optimized health surveillance , and facilitation in use of community services .
METHODS	Primary endpoints were event-free survival , all-cause hospital readmission , and mortality during the 9-month follow-up .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints were length of hospital stay , self-care , and health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) .
METHODS	Data were analyzed using survival analysis and generalized estimating equations , following an intention-to-treat principle .
RESULTS	Survival analysis indicated no significant differences in event-free survival , hospital readmission , or mortality between the TC and UC groups , although the TC group had a lower hospital readmission rate at 6 weeks ( 8.1 % vs 16.3 % , P = .048 ) and lower mortality at 9 months ( 4.1 % vs 13.8 % , P = .03 ) .
RESULTS	The TC group also had a shorter hospital stay ( P = .006 ) and significantly better self-care and HRQL .
RESULTS	Because of attrition , sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine whether the intention-to-treat assumption affected the results .
RESULTS	Per-protocol population analyses ( hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.40 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.17-0 .93 ) and worst-case-scenario analysis ( HR = 0.44 , 95 % CI = 0.25-0 .77 ) suggested a lower mortality risk in the TC group .
CONCLUSIONS	The translation of individual-centered nurse-implemented TC to the Chinese culture and healthcare context of Hong Kong appears beneficial .

BACKGROUND	To investigate the mechanism of action of tranexamic acid ( TXA ) in bleeding trauma patients , we examined the timing of its effect on mortality .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesised that if TXA reduces mortality by decreasing blood loss , its effect should be greatest on the day of the injury when bleeding is most profuse .
BACKGROUND	However , if TXA reduces mortality via an anti-inflammatory mechanism its effect should be greater over the subsequent days .
METHODS	Exploratory analysis , including per-protocol analyses , of data from the CRASH-2 trial , a randomised placebo controlled trial of the effect of TXA on mortality in 20,211 trauma patients with , or at risk of , significant bleeding .
METHODS	We examined hazard ratios ( HR ) and 95 % confidence intervals for all-cause mortality , deaths due to bleeding and non-bleeding deaths , according to the day since injury .
METHODS	The CRASH-2 trial is registered as ISRCTN86750102 and ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00375258 .
RESULTS	The effect of TXA on mortality is greatest for deaths occurring on the day of the injury ( HR all-cause mortality = 0.83 , 0.73 to 0.93 ) .
RESULTS	This survival benefit is only evident in patients in whom treatment is initiated within 3 hours of their injury ( HR 3 hours = 0.78 , 0.68 to 0.90 ; HR > 3 hours = 1.02 , 0.76 to 1.36 ) .
RESULTS	Initiation of TXA treatment within 3 hours of injury reduced the hazard of death due to bleeding on the day of the injury by 28 % ( HR = 0.72 , 0.60 to 0.86 ) .
RESULTS	TXA treatment initiated beyond 3 hours of injury appeared to increase the hazard of death due to bleeding , although the estimates were imprecise .
CONCLUSIONS	Early administration of tranexamic acid appears to reduce mortality primarily by preventing exsanguination on the day of the injury .

BACKGROUND	Photoperiod is known to cause physiological changes in seasonal mammals , including changes in body weight , physical activity , reproductive status , and adipose tissue gene expression in several species .
BACKGROUND	The objective of this study was to determine the effects of day length on the adipose transcriptome of cats as assessed by RNA sequencing .
BACKGROUND	Ten healthy adult neutered male domestic shorthair cats were used in a randomized crossover design study .
BACKGROUND	During two 12-wk periods , cats were exposed to either short days ( 8 hr light :16 hr dark ) or long days ( 16 hr light :8 hr dark ) .
BACKGROUND	Cats were fed a commercial diet to maintain baseline body weight to avoid weight-related bias .
BACKGROUND	Subcutaneous adipose biopsies were collected at wk 12 of each period for RNA isolation and sequencing .
RESULTS	A total of 578 million sequences ( 28.9 million/sample ) were generated by Illumina sequencing .
RESULTS	A total of 170 mRNA transcripts were differentially expressed between short day - and long day-housed cats .
RESULTS	89 annotated transcripts were up-regulated by short days , while 24 annotated transcripts were down-regulated by short days .
RESULTS	Another 57 un-annotated transcripts were also different between groups .
RESULTS	Adipose tissue of short day-housed cats had greater expression of genes involved with cell growth and differentiation ( e.g. , myostatin ; frizzled-related protein ) , cell development and structure ( e.g. , cytokeratins ) , and protein processing and ubiquitination ( e.g. , kelch-like proteins ) .
RESULTS	In contrast , short day-housed cats had decreased expression of genes involved with immune function ( e.g. , plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 ; chemokine ( C-C motif ) ligand 2 ; C-C motif chemokine 5 ; T-cell activators ) , and altered expression of genes associated with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism .
CONCLUSIONS	Collectively , these gene expression changes suggest that short day housing may promote adipogenesis , minimize inflammation and oxidative stress , and alter nutrient metabolism in feline adipose tissue , even when fed to maintain body weight .
CONCLUSIONS	Although this study has highlighted molecular mechanisms contributing to the seasonal metabolic changes observed in cats , future research that specifically targets and studies these biological pathways , and the physiological outcomes that are affected by them , is justified .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of lutein on systemic complement activation in elderly individuals .
METHODS	Seventy patients with signs of early age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) were included in this study .
METHODS	All subjects were randomly assigned to receive a 10 mg daily dose of lutein or a placebo for a time period of 1 year .
METHODS	EDTA blood was collected before and at various time-points during the study ( 0 , 4 , 8 and 12 months ) .
METHODS	The plasma level of the soluble complement membrane attack complex sC5b-9 was measured by ELISA .
RESULTS	We found a significant 1.1 ng/ml monthly decrease in the plasma sC5b-9 concentration in the lutein group ( p < 0.001 ) , resulting in a decrease from 60.3 ng/ml at baseline to 46.3 ng/ml at 12 months .
RESULTS	For the placebo group , we found a significant 0.6 ng/ml monthly increase in plasma sC5b-9 concentration ( p = 0.001 ) , resulting in an increase from 51.6 ng/ml at baseline to 58.4 ng/ml at 12 months .
CONCLUSIONS	Lutein supplementation inhibits the systemic activation of the complement system , which provides further functional evidence for the reported beneficial effects of this carotenoid in the management of AMD .

BACKGROUND	Tuberculosis ( TB ) is common among HIV-infected individuals in many resource-limited countries and has been associated with poor survival .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated morbidity and mortality among individuals first starting antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) with concurrent active TB or other AIDS-defining disease using data from the `` Prospective Evaluation of Antiretrovirals in Resource-Limited Settings '' ( PEARLS ) study .
METHODS	PARTICIPANTS WERE CATEGORIZED RETROSPECTIVELY INTO THREE GROUPS ACCORDING TO PRESENCE OF ACTIVE CONFIRMED OR PRESUMPTIVE DISEASE AT ART INITIATION : those with pulmonary and/or extrapulmonary TB ( `` TB '' group ) , those with other non-TB AIDS-defining disease ( `` other disease '' ) , or those without concurrent TB or other AIDS-defining disease ( `` no disease '' ) .
METHODS	Primary outcome was time to the first of virologic failure , HIV disease progression or death .
METHODS	Since the groups differed in characteristics , proportional hazard models were used to compare the hazard of the primary outcome among study groups , adjusting for age , sex , country , screening CD4 count , baseline viral load and ART regimen .
RESULTS	31 of 102 participants ( 30 % ) in the `` TB '' group , 11 of 56 ( 20 % ) in the `` other disease '' group , and 287 of 1413 ( 20 % ) in the `` no disease '' group experienced a primary outcome event ( p = 0.042 ) .
RESULTS	This difference reflected higher mortality in the TB group : 15 ( 15 % ) , 0 ( 0 % ) and 41 ( 3 % ) participants died , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	The adjusted hazard ratio comparing the `` TB '' and `` no disease '' groups was 1.39 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.93-2 .10 ; p = 0.11 ) for the primary outcome and 3.41 ( 1.72-6 .75 ; p < 0.001 ) for death .
CONCLUSIONS	Active TB at ART initiation was associated with increased risk of mortality in HIV-1 infected patients .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the clinical efficacy in the treatment of post-stroke shoulder-hand syndrome between floating-needle therapy and conventional acupuncture on the basis of rehabilitation training .
METHODS	One hundred cases of post-stroke shoulder-hand syndrome were randomized into a floating-needle group and an acupuncture group , 50 cases in each one .
METHODS	The passive and positive rehabilitation training was adopted in the two groups .
METHODS	Additionally , in the floating-needle group , the floating-needle therapy was used .
METHODS	The needle was inserted at the site 5 to 10 cm away from myofasical trigger point ( MTrP ) , manipulated and scattered subcutaneously , for 2 min continuously .
METHODS	In the acupuncture group , the conventional acupuncture was applied at Jianqian ( EX-UE ) , Jianyu ( LI 15 ) , Jianliao ( TE 14 ) , etc. .
METHODS	The treatment was given once every two days , 3 times a week , and 14 days of treatment were required .
METHODS	The shoulder hand syndrome scale ( SHSS ) , the short form McGill pain scale ( SF-MPQ ) and the modified Fugl-Meyer motor function scale ( FMA ) were used to evaluate the damage severity , pain and motor function of the upper limbs before and after treatment in the two groups .
METHODS	The clinical efficacy was compared between the two groups .
RESULTS	SHSS score , SF-MPQ score and FMA score were improved significantly after treatment in the two groups ( all P < 0.01 ) , and the improvements in the floating-needle group were superior to those in the acupuncture group ( all P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	The total effective rate was 94.0 % ( 47/50 ) in the floating-needle group , which was better than 90.0 % ( 45/50 ) in the acupuncture group ( P < 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The floating-needle therapy combined with rehabilitation training achieves a satisfactory efficacy on post-stroke shoulder-hand syndrome , which is better than the combined therapy of conventional acupuncture and rehabilitation training .

OBJECTIVE	To prospectively determine the feasibility of low-iodine-load and low-tube-voltage computed tomographic ( CT ) angiographic imaging of the kidney and to evaluate the opacification and image quality compared with moderate-iodine-load and high-iodine-load techniques .
METHODS	Institutional review board approval and written informed consent was obtained .
METHODS	One hundred thirteen consecutive patients randomly underwent three protocols for dual-phase renal CT angiographic imaging : high-iodine-load ( 600 mg iodine per kilogram of body weight at 120 kVp ) ; moderate-iodine-load ( 400 mg iodine per kilogram of body weight at 80 kVp ) ; and low-iodine-load ( contrast agent injection initially prepared at 400 mg iodine per kilogram of body weight but stopped immediately after bolus-tracking trigger at 80 kVp ) scanning .
METHODS	CT numbers of vessels and kidneys were measured .
METHODS	CT numbers and signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) were compared with one-way analysis of variance and posthoc Tukey-Kramer test and depiction of vessels and image noise , with Kruskal-Wallis test and pair-wise Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni correction .
RESULTS	Mean iodine weight administered was significantly reduced in order of low - ( 16.4 g ) , moderate - ( 23.5 g ) , and high-iodine-load ( 33.7 g ) protocols ( P < .001 ) .
RESULTS	Mean CT numbers of abdominal aorta , renal artery , and renal cortex in first phase were significantly lower with high-iodine-load protocol ( 308 , 274 , and 132 HU , respectively ) than with moderate - ( 347 , 334 , and 156 HU , respectively ; P = .001 -.006 ) or low-iodine-load ( 362 , 316 , and 161 HU , respectively ; P = .001 -.003 ) protocol .
RESULTS	Mean CT number of renal vein in second phase was significantly lower with low-iodine-load protocol ( 223 HU ) than with moderate - ( 299 HU ; P < .001 ) or high-iodine-load ( 258 HU ; P = .020 ) .
RESULTS	Mean SNR of renal medulla in second phase was significantly lower ( P = .019 ) with moderate-iodine-load protocol ( mean SNR , 7.2 ) than with high-iodine-load protocol ( mean SNR , 10.0 ) .
RESULTS	No significant difference in image quality grades was found between high-iodine-load ( mean grade , 2.6-2 .9 ) , moderate-iodine-load ( mean grade , 2.6-3 .0 ) , and low-iodine-load ( mean grade , 2.6-2 .9 ) protocols ( P = .018 -.31 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Combined application of low-iodine-load , bolus tracking with saline flushing , and low-tube-voltage scanning is feasible and resulted in substantial reduction of iodine dose for renal CT angiographic imaging without compromising image quality .

BACKGROUND	Transendocardial stem cell injection ( TESI ) with mesenchymal stem cells improves remodeling in chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy , but the effect of the injection site remains unknown .
OBJECTIVE	To address whether TESI exerts its effects at the site of injection only or also in remote areas , we hypothesized that segmental myocardial scar and segmental ejection fraction improve to a greater extent in injected than in noninjected segments .
RESULTS	Biplane ventriculographic and endocardial tracings were recorded .
RESULTS	TESI was guided to 10 sites in infarct-border zones .
RESULTS	Sites were mapped according to the 17-myocardial segment model .
RESULTS	As a result , 510 segments were analyzed in 30 patients before and 13 months after TESI .
RESULTS	Segmental early enhancement defect ( a measure of scar size ) was reduced by TESI in both injected ( -43.7 4.4 % ; n = 95 ; P < 0.01 ) and noninjected segments ( -25.1 7.8 % ; n = 148 ; P < 0.001 ; between-group comparison P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	Conversely , segmental ejection fraction ( a measure of contractile performance ) improved in injected scar segments ( 19.9 3.3-26 .3 3.5 % ; P = 0.003 ) but not in noninjected scar segments ( 21.3 2.6-23 .5 3.2 % ; P = 0.20 ; between-group comparison P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , segmental ejection fraction in injected scar segments improved to a greater degree in patients with baseline segmental ejection fraction < 20 % ( 12.1 1.2-19 .9 2.7 % ; n = 18 ; P = 0.003 ) , versus < 20 % ( 31.7 3.4-35 .5 3.3 % ; n = 12 ; P = 0.33 , between-group comparison P < 0.0001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings illustrate a dichotomy in regional responses to TESI .
CONCLUSIONS	Although scar size reduction was evident in all scar segments , scar size reduction and ventricular functional responses preferentially occurred at the sites of TESI versus non-TESI sites .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , improvement was greatest when segmental left ventricular dysfunction was severe .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the effectiveness of recombinant human ( rh ) IL-11 to increase platelets count in patients suffering from Dengue fever ( DF ) .
METHODS	Randomized double blind placebo control study .
METHODS	Farooq Hospital , Lahore , from July to October 2011 .
METHODS	Forty hospitalized patients suffering from Dengue fever having platelets count 30000 per micro liter were randomly categorized into two groups , rhIL-11 ( test ) and distilled water ( placebo ) groups .
METHODS	The efficacy outcomes ( as indicated by step up in platelets count at 48 hours ) for the treatment group were compared with the outcomes for the placebo group .
RESULTS	The data revealed that the increase in platelet response with recombinant human interleukin 11 , 1.5 mg subcutaneously is significantly more brisk than the placebo group .
RESULTS	The platelets response in patients with severe thrombocytopenia was greater in the treatment group ( 50 % ) at 48 hours as compared to the placebo group ( 20 % ) ( p = 0.047 ) .
RESULTS	Response rate was slightly greater among males ( 6/10 , 60 % ) than females ( 8/16 , 50 % ) ; moreover , three-fourth ( 75 % ) female responders were in the placebo group , compared to half ( 50 % ) male responders in the treatment group .
CONCLUSIONS	Results of the study suggest that treatment of severe thrombocytopenia accompanying DF with recombinant human interleukin11 may be a useful therapeutic option .

BACKGROUND	People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lead sedentary lives and could benefit from increasing their physical activity .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to determine if an exercise-specific self-efficacy enhancing intervention could increase physical activity and functional performance when delivered in the context of 4 months of upper body resistance training with a 12-month follow-up .
METHODS	IN THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL , SUBJECTS WERE ASSIGNED TO : exercise-specific self-efficacy enhancing intervention with upper body resistance training ( SE-UBR ) , health education with upper body resistance training ( ED-UBR ) , or health education with gentle chair exercises ( ED-Chair ) .
METHODS	Physical activity was measured with an accelerometer and functional performance was measured with the Functional Performance Inventory .
METHODS	Forty-nine people with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease completed 4 months of training and provided valid accelerometry data , and 34 also provided accelerometry data at 12 months of follow-up .
METHODS	The self-efficacy enhancing intervention emphasized meeting physical activity guidelines and increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity .
RESULTS	Differences were observed in light physical activity ( LPA ) after 4 months of training , time by group interaction effect ( P = 0.045 ) .
RESULTS	The SE-UBR group increased time spent in LPA by +20.6829.30 minutes/day and the other groups decreased time spent in LPA by -22.4347.88 minutes/day and -25.7351.76 minutes/day .
RESULTS	Changes in LPA were not sustained at 12-month follow-up .
RESULTS	There were no significant changes in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity , sedentary time , or functional performance .
RESULTS	Subjects spent most of their waking hours sedentary : 72 % 9 % for SE-UBR , 68 % 10 % for ED-UBR , and 74 % 9 % for ED-Chair .
CONCLUSIONS	The self-efficacy enhancing intervention produced a modest short-term increase in LPA .
CONCLUSIONS	Further work is needed to increase the magnitude and duration of effect , possibly by targeting LPA .

BACKGROUND	Inhaled endotoxin induces airways ` neutrophilia , in human .
BACKGROUND	TNF-a being a key cytokine in the response to endotoxin , the effect of anti-TNF on the endotoxin-induced neutrophilic response was evaluated among healthy volunteers .
METHODS	Among a population of 30 healthy subjects , an induced-sputum was collected 2 weeks before , and 24 hours after an inhalation of 20 mcg endotoxin ( E. coli 026 : B6 ) .
METHODS	Then , the subjects were randomized into 3 parallel groups treated with control , oral methylprednisolone 20 mg/day during 7 days or anti-TNF ( adalimumab , Humira , Abbott ) 40 mg s.c. .
METHODS	One week later , an induced-sputum was sampled , 24 hours after an inhalation of endotoxin .
RESULTS	After endotoxin inhalation , the number of total cells , neutrophils and macrophages was significantly increased ( p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	Compared to the response to endotoxin among the control group , anti-TNF inhibited the endotoxin-induced neutrophil influx , both in relative ( 51.3 ( 6.4 ) % versus 26.2 ( 5.3 ) % , p < 0.002 ) and in absolute values ( 1321 ( 443-3935 ) cells/mcL versus 247 ( 68-906 ) cells/mcL , p < 0.02 ) .
RESULTS	The endotoxin-induced neutrophilic response was not significantly modified among the control group and oral corticosteroid group .
CONCLUSIONS	While oral corticosteroid had no effect , anti-TNF inhibited the neutrophil influx in sputum , induced by inhalation of endotoxin , in human subject .
CONCLUSIONS	The endotoxin model could be an early predictor of clinical efficacy of novel therapeutics .

OBJECTIVE	A previously published study demonstrated a pharmacogenetic association between the minor alleles of 2 VEGFR2 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and greater improvement in visual acuity ( VA ) to treatment with ranibizumab , an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) drug , in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated whether this association was replicated among patients who participated in the Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials ( CATT ) or the Alternative Treatments to Inhibit VEGF in Patients with Age-Related Choroidal Neovascularisation ( IVAN ) trial .
METHODS	Cohort studies within randomized clinical trials .
METHODS	Eight hundred thirty-five patients participating in CATT and 512 patients participating in IVAN .
METHODS	Each patient was genotyped for the SNPs rs4576072 and rs6828477 in the VEGFR2 gene .
METHODS	Mean change in VA from baseline to 1 year after initiation of treatment with ranibizumab or bevacizumab .
METHODS	Differences in VA response between the patient group homozygous for the minor allele of each SNP and the other genotype groups were evaluated with analysis of variance .
METHODS	Differences in VA response by the number of minor alleles present for either SNP or both combined were evaluated with tests of linear trend .
METHODS	Analyses were conducted separately for CATT and IVAN participants and with both the studies combined .
RESULTS	No statistically significant difference in mean change in VA was identified between genotypes of either SNP ( P 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , a stepwise analysis failed to show a significant interaction for either SNP based on the number of minor alleles present .
RESULTS	The lack of association was similar in both the CATT and IVAN cohorts and whether the analysis combined patients treated with either ranibizumab or bevacizumab or when restricted to patients treated with ranibizumab only .
CONCLUSIONS	The CATT and IVAN data do not support a pharmacogenetic association between the 2VEGFR2 SNPs , rs4576072 and rs6828477 , and change in VA in response to anti-VEGF therapy in patients with neovascular AMD .

OBJECTIVE	Amiodarone is used commonly for pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , but it is limited by moderate efficacy and delayed action .
OBJECTIVE	Ranolazine and amiodarone are markedly synergistic in suppressing experimental AF in vitro , yet the clinical efficacy of ranolazine combined with amiodarone for AF conversion has only undergone minimal investigation .
OBJECTIVE	This prospective , single-blinded , randomized study compared the safety and efficacy of ranolazine added to amiodarone vs. amiodarone alone for conversion of recent-onset AF .
RESULTS	We enroled 121 patients ( 64 10 years , 45 % male ) with recent-onset ( < 48 h duration ) AF who were eligible for pharmacological cardioversion .
RESULTS	Patients received either 24 h amiodarone infusion ( loading dose 5 mg/kg followed by maintenance dose of 50 mg/h ; n = 60 ) , or amiodarone infusion at the same dosage plus a single oral dose of ranolazine 1500 mg ( n = 61 ) .
RESULTS	Patients in the amiodarone plus ranolazine group compared with the amiodarone-only group showed significantly higher conversion rates at 24 h ( 87 vs. 70 % , respectively ; P = 0.024 ) and at 12 h ( 52 vs. 32 % ; P = 0.021 ) , and shorter time to conversion ( 10.2 3.3 vs. 13.3 4.1 h ; P = 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	Subgroup analysis identified higher 24 h conversion in patients with left atrial ( LA ) diameter > 46 mm who received the combination treatment vs. amiodarone alone ( 81 vs. 54 % ; P = 0.02 ) , whereas the efficacy of the two interventions did not differ among patients with LA diameter 46 mm ( P = 0.77 ) .
RESULTS	There was modest QT prolongation in both the groups , no serious adverse reactions , and no pro-arrhythmic events .
CONCLUSIONS	Addition of ranolazine to amiodarone was safe and well tolerated in this study , and it demonstrated efficacy superior to amiodarone alone for conversion of recent-onset AF .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings may have clinical implications by offering a simple therapeutic manoeuvre to enhance amiodarone 's effectiveness for conversion of AF .

BACKGROUND	QVA149 is an inhaled fixed-dose combination therapy under development for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .
BACKGROUND	It combines indacaterol ( a longacting 2-agonist ) with glycopyrronium ( a longacting muscarinic antagonist ) as a dual bronchodilator .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to compare the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of QVA149 versus salmeterol-fluticasone ( SFC ) over 26 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD .
METHODS	In this multicentre double-blind , double-dummy , parallel-group study , 523 patients ( age 40 years or older , Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [ GOLD ] stages II-III , without exacerbations in the previous year ) were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ; via automated , interactive response technology and stratified for smoking status ) to once-daily QVA149 110/50 g or twice-daily SFC 50/500 g for 26 weeks .
METHODS	Efficacy was assessed in the full analysis set ( randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug ) ; safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was to demonstrate the superiority of QVA149 compared with SFC for the standardised area under the curve from 0 to 12 h post dose for forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 AUC0-12h ) after 26 weeks of treatment .
METHODS	This trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov , NCT01315249 .
RESULTS	Between March 25 , 2011 , and March 12 , 2012 , 259 patients were randomly assigned to receive QVA149 and 264 to receive SFC. At week 26 , FEV1 AUC0-12h was significantly higher with QVA149 than with SFC ( treatment difference 0138 L ; 95 % CI 0100-0176 ; p < 00001 ) .
RESULTS	Overall incidence of adverse events ( including COPD exacerbations ) was 554 % ( 143 of 258 ) for the QVA149 group and 602 % ( 159 of 264 ) for the SFC group .
RESULTS	Incidence of serious adverse events was similar between treatment groups ( QVA149 , 13 of 258 [ 50 % ] ; SFC 14 of 264 [ 53 % ] ) ; COPD worsening was the most frequent serious adverse event ( one of 13 [ 04 % ] and three of 14 [ 11 % ] , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Once-daily QVA149 provides significant , sustained , and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function versus twice-daily SFC , with significant symptomatic benefit .
CONCLUSIONS	These results indicate the potential of dual bronchodilation as a treatment option for non-exacerbating symptomatic COPD patients .

BACKGROUND	Though current hospital paging systems are neither efficient ( callbacks disrupt workflow ) , nor secure ( pagers are not Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [ HIPAA ] - compliant ) , they are routinely used to communicate patient information .
BACKGROUND	Smartphone-based text messaging is a potentially more convenient and efficient mobile alternative ; however , commercial cellular networks are also not secure .
OBJECTIVE	To determine if augmenting one-way pagers with Medigram , a secure , HIPAA-compliant group messaging ( HCGM ) application for smartphones , could improve hospital team communication .
METHODS	Eight-week prospective , cluster-randomized , controlled trial
METHODS	Stanford Hospital
METHODS	Three inpatient medicine teams used the HCGM application in addition to paging , while two inpatient medicine teams used paging only for intra-team communication .
METHODS	Baseline and post-study surveys were collected from 22 control and 41 HCGM team members .
RESULTS	When compared with paging , HCGM was rated significantly ( P < 0.05 ) more effective in : ( 1 ) allowing users to communicate thoughts clearly ( P = 0.010 ) and efficiently ( P = 0.009 ) and ( 2 ) integrating into workflow during rounds ( P = 0.018 ) and patient discharge ( P = 0.012 ) .
RESULTS	Overall satisfaction with HCGM was significantly higher ( P = 0.003 ) .
RESULTS	85 % of HCGM team respondents said they would recommend using an HCGM system on the wards .
CONCLUSIONS	Smartphone-based , HIPAA-compliant group messaging applications improve provider perception of in-hospital communication , while providing the information security that paging and commercial cellular networks do not .

BACKGROUND	Evidence of a beneficial effect of exercise training on mediators of vascular disease is accumulating in chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , but its effect on vascular function in vivo still has to be established .
BACKGROUND	The present study was designed to investigate whether a formal aerobic exercise training program improves peripheral endothelial function in patients with CKD stages 3 to 4 .
METHODS	Randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design .
METHODS	48 patients with CKD stages 3 to 4 without established cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to either an exercise training program or usual care .
METHODS	40 patients completed the study ( exercise training , 19 ; usual care , 21 ) .
METHODS	The 3-month home-based aerobic training program consisted of 4 daily cycling sessions of 10 minutes each at a target heart rate , calculated as 90 % of the heart rate achieved at the anaerobic threshold .
METHODS	Patients in the usual-care group were given standard therapy .
RESULTS	The primary outcome was peripheral endothelial function .
RESULTS	Secondary outcomes were aerobic capacity , arterial stiffness , numbers of endothelial ( EPCs ) and osteogenic progenitor cells ( OPCs ) , migratory function of circulatory angiogenic cells , and health-related quality of life .
METHODS	Endothelial function was assessed with flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery , aerobic capacity by peak oxygen uptake ( VO ( 2peak ) ) , arterial stiffness by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity , numbers of EPCs and OPCs by flow cytometry , circulatory angiogenic cell function by an in vitro migratory assay , and quality of life by the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form questionnaire .
RESULTS	Exercise training significantly improved VO ( 2peak ) and quality of life , but not in vivo vascular function ( flow-mediated dilation and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ) or cellular markers for vascular function ( EPC and OPC count and circulatory angiogenic cell migratory function ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Short duration and intermittent nature of the exercise intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with CKD stages 3 to 4 without overt cardiovascular disease , 3 months of aerobic exercise training improved VO ( 2peak ) and quality of life , without altering endothelial function or arterial stiffness .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the most efficient route and timing of oxytocin administration for active management of the third stage of labor .
METHODS	A prospective randomized study was done at one center in Ankara , Turkey , between January and October 2010 .
METHODS	Women with a singleton pregnancy ( > 37 weeks ) who had a live vaginal birth were randomly allocated to four groups : iv-A ( intravenous oxytocin after delivery of the fetus ) , iv-B ( when anterior shoulder seen ) , im-A ( intramuscular oxytocin after delivery ) , and im-B ( when anterior shoulder seen ) .
METHODS	Postpartum blood loss within the first hour , hemoglobin , hematocrit , and duration of the third stage were compared .
RESULTS	A total of 600 eligible women were recruited ; 150 were assigned to each group .
RESULTS	Postpartum blood loss , prepartum and postpartum hemoglobin and hematocrit , and need for additional uterotonics were similar among groups ( P > 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	The duration of the third stage of labor and changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit were significantly reduced in group iv-B ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	Among women not exposed to oxytocin before delivery , postpartum blood loss was significantly lower in group iv-B ( P = 0.019 ) .
RESULTS	Labor augmentation was related to significantly increased postpartum blood loss in all groups except iv-A .
CONCLUSIONS	Although postpartum blood loss was similar in all groups , early intravenous administration seemed to have beneficial effects .
CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT01954186 .

BACKGROUND	Stroke is the second-leading cause of death in low - and middle-income countries , but use of evidence-based therapies for stroke prevention in such countries , especially those in Africa , is extremely poor .
BACKGROUND	This study is designed to enhance the implementation and sustainability of secondary stroke-preventive services following hospital discharge .
OBJECTIVE	The primary study aim is to test whether a Chronic Care Model-based initiative entitled the Tailored Hospital-based Risk reduction to Impede Vascular Events after Stroke ( THRIVES ) significantly improves blood pressure control after stroke .
METHODS	This prospective triple-blind randomized controlled trial will include a cohort of 400 patients with a recent stroke discharged from four medical care facilities in Nigeria .
METHODS	The culturally sensitive , system-appropriate intervention comprises patient report cards , phone text messaging , an educational video , and coordination of posthospitalization care .
RESULTS	The primary outcome is improvement of blood pressure control .
RESULTS	Secondary endpoints include control of other stroke risk factors , medication adherence , functional status , and quality of life .
RESULTS	We will also perform a cost analysis of THRIVES from the viewpoint of government policy-makers .
CONCLUSIONS	We anticipate that a successful intervention will serve as a scalable model of effective postdischarge chronic blood pressure management for stroke in sub-Saharan Africa and possibly for other symptomatic cardiovascular disease entities in the region .

BACKGROUND	Postoperative surgical site infections are one of the most frequent complications after open abdominal surgery , and triclosan-coated sutures were developed to reduce their occurrence .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the PROUD trial was to obtain reliable data for the effectiveness of triclosan-coated PDS Plus sutures for abdominal wall closure , compared with non-coated PDS II sutures , in the prevention of surgical site infections .
METHODS	This multicentre , randomised controlled group-sequential superiority trial was done in 24 German hospitals .
METHODS	Adult patients ( aged 18 years ) who underwent elective midline abdominal laparotomy for any reason were eligible for inclusion .
METHODS	Exclusion criteria were impaired mental state , language problems , and participation in another intervention trial that interfered with the intervention or outcome of this trial .
METHODS	A central web-based randomisation tool was used to randomly assign eligible participants by permuted block randomisation with a 1:1 allocation ratio and block size 4 before mass closure to either triclosan-coated sutures ( PDS Plus ) or uncoated sutures ( PDS II ) for abdominal fascia closure .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the occurrence of superficial or deep surgical site infection according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria within 30 days after the operation .
METHODS	Patients , surgeons , and the outcome assessors were masked to group assignment .
METHODS	Interim and final analyses were by modified intention to treat .
METHODS	This trial is registered with the German Clinical Trials Register , number DRKS00000390 .
RESULTS	Between April 7 , 2010 , and Oct 19 , 2012 , 1224 patients were randomly assigned to intervention groups ( 607 to PDS Plus , and 617 to PDS II ) , of whom 1185 ( 587 PDS Plus and 598 PDS II ) were analysed by intention to treat .
RESULTS	The study groups were well balanced in terms of patient and procedure characteristics .
RESULTS	The occurrence of surgical site infections did not differ between the PDS Plus group ( 87 [ 148 % ] of 587 ) and the PDS II group ( 96 [ 161 % ] of 598 ; OR 091 , 95 % CI 066-125 ; p = 064 ) .
RESULTS	Serious adverse events also did not differ between the groups-146 of 583 ( 250 % ) patients treated with PDS Plus had at least one serious adverse event , compared with 138 of 602 ( 229 % ) patients treated with PDS II ; p = 039 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Triclosan-coated PDS Plus did not reduce the occurrence of surgical site infection after elective midline laparotomy .
CONCLUSIONS	Innovative , multifactorial strategies need to be developed and assessed in future trials to reduce surgical site infections .

OBJECTIVE	Tonsillectomy is the oldest and most frequently performed surgical procedure practiced by ear , nose , and throat physicians .
OBJECTIVE	In this study , our aim was to compare the analgesic effects of peritonsillar , rectal , as well as intravenous infiltration of ketamine and intravenous tramadol hydrochloride infiltration for postoperative pain relief and sedation after tonsillectomy in children .
METHODS	This randomized controlled study evaluated the effects of peritonsillar , intravenous , and rectal infiltration of ketamine in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy .
METHODS	One hundred twenty children who were categorized under American Society of Anesthesiologists classes I to II were randomized to 4 groups of 30 members each .
METHODS	Group 1 received intravenous ( IV ) ketamine ( 0.5 mg/kg ) , group 2 received rectal ketamine ( 0.5 mg/kg ) , group 3 received local peritonsillar ketamine ( 2 mg/kg ) , and the control group received IV tramadol hydrochloride infiltration ( 2 mg/kg ) .
METHODS	Children 's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale scores and Wilson sedation scale were recorded at minutes 1 , 15 , 30 , 60 as well as hours 2 , 12 , and 24 postoperatively .
METHODS	The patients were interviewed on the day after the surgery to assess the postoperative pain and sedation .
RESULTS	All the routes of infiltration of ketamine were as effective as those of tramadol hydrochloride ( P > 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	A statistically significant difference was observed between IV infiltrations and all groups during the assessments at hours 6 and 24 .
RESULTS	The analgesic efficacy of IV ketamine was found especially higher at hours 6 and 24 ( P ( 6 ) = 0.045 , P ( 24 ) = 0.011 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Perioperative , low-dose IV , rectal , or peritonsillar ketamine infiltration provides efficient pain relief without any adverse effects in children who would undergo adenotonsillectomy .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the long-term clinical safety between two drug-eluting stents with different healing characteristics in the Patient Related Outcomes with Endeavour ( E-ZES ) vs. Cypher ( C-SES ) Stenting Trial ( PROTECT ) .
OBJECTIVE	At 3 years , there was no difference in the primary outcome of definite or probable stent thrombosis or in the other main secondary clinical outcomes consisting of the composite of death or myocardial infarction ( MI ) .
OBJECTIVE	Prespecified 4-year clinical follow-up was analysed .
RESULTS	Patient Related OuTcomes with Endeavour vs. Cypher Stenting Trial was a prospective , open-label randomized-controlled superiority trial powered to look at differences in long-term clinical safety , including stent thrombosis .
RESULTS	Dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) was prescribed for 3 months and up to 12 months based on current guidelines .
RESULTS	Patient Related OuTcomes with Endeavour vs. Cypher Stenting Trial enrolled 8791 patients undergoing elective or emergency PCI to E-ZES or C-SES .
RESULTS	There was no difference in DAPT usage between the two groups up to 4 years .
RESULTS	At 4-year follow-up , the primary outcome occurred in 1.6 % of E-ZES vs. 2.6 % of C-SES patients [ HR 0.63 ( 95 % CI 0.46-0 .85 ) , P = 0.003 ] .
RESULTS	The composite of all-cause death or large MI occurred in 6.7 % of E-ZES vs. 8.0 % of C-SES-treated patients [ HR 0.84 ( 95 % CI 0.71-0 .98 ) , P = 0.024 ] .
CONCLUSIONS	Drug-eluting coronary stents with different healing characteristics demonstrated different late safety profiles : after 4 years , compared with C-SES , E-ZES reduced the risk of stent thrombosis and the risk of the composite endpoints of death or MI .
CONCLUSIONS	Appropriately powered large-scale trials with long-term follow-up are critical to determine clinical safety and efficacy of permanently implanted coronary stents .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00476957 .

OBJECTIVE	This 2-arm crossover study compared the relative bioavailability of two dovitinib ( TKI258 ) formulations [ anhydrate clinical service form ( CSF ) capsule and monohydrate final market image ( FMI ) tablet ; Arm 1 ] and determined the effect of food on dovitinib exposure ( Arm 2 ) .
METHODS	Patients with advanced solid tumors , excluding breast cancer , were enrolled in 1 of the 2 arms of the study .
METHODS	Patients in Arm 1 were randomized to a single 500-mg dose of CSF capsule or FMI tablet followed by 7 days of rest and 500 mg of the other formulation .
METHODS	Patients in Arm 2 received 300 mg of FMI tablet daily and were randomized to follow 1 of 6 meal sequences , each with 3 prandial conditions : low fat ( LF ) , high fat ( HF ) , or no meal ( NM ) .
RESULTS	In Arm 1 ( n = 21 ) , 17 patients were evaluable .
RESULTS	FMI tablet compared with CSF capsule showed only slight reductions in the adjusted geometric means for area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUClast ; 3 % ) and maximum plasma concentration ( C max ; 1 % ) .
RESULTS	In Arm 2 ( n = 42 ) , 19 patients were evaluable .
RESULTS	HF meal versus NM showed a 9 % decrease in the adjusted geometric mean for AUClast and an 18 % decrease for C max .
RESULTS	Comparison of LF meal versus NM showed a 1 % decrease for AUClast and a 10 % decrease for C max .
RESULTS	Common adverse events suspected to be study drug related included vomiting , diarrhea , nausea , and fatigue .
CONCLUSIONS	Dovitinib FMI tablet had similar systemic exposure to the CSF capsule and was not affected by food .

OBJECTIVE	In a published study on cervical cancer , 5-beam IMRT was inferior to single arc VMAT .
OBJECTIVE	Here we compare 9 , 12 , and 20 beam IMRT with single and dual arc VMAT .
METHODS	For each of 10 patients , automated plan generation with the in-house Erasmus-iCycle optimizer was used to assist an expert planner in generating the five plans with the clinical TPS .
RESULTS	For each patient , all plans were clinically acceptable with a high and similar PTV coverage .
RESULTS	OAR sparing increased when going from 9 to 12 to 20 IMRT beams , and from single to dual arc VMAT .
RESULTS	For all patients , 12 and 20 beam IMRT were superior to single and dual arc VMAT , with substantial variations in gain among the study patients .
RESULTS	As expected , delivery of VMAT plans was significantly faster than delivery of IMRT plans .
CONCLUSIONS	Often reported increased plan quality for VMAT compared to IMRT has not been observed for cervical cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	Twenty and 12 beam IMRT plans had a higher quality than single and dual arc VMAT .
CONCLUSIONS	For individual patients , the optimal delivery technique depends on a complex trade-off between plan quality and treatment time that may change with introduction of faster delivery systems .

OBJECTIVE	Depression is common in heart failure ( HF ) and associated with adverse outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	Randomized comparisons of the effectiveness of HF care strategies by patients ' mood are scarce .
OBJECTIVE	We therefore investigated in a randomized trial a structured collaborative disease management programme ( HeartNetCare-HF ; HNC ) recording mortality , morbidity , and symptoms in patients enrolled after hospitalization for decompensated systolic HF according to their responses to the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) during an observation period of 180 days .
RESULTS	Subjects scoring < 12/12 were categorized as non-depressed/depressed , and those ignoring the questionnaire as PHQ-deniers .
RESULTS	Amongst 715 participants ( 6912years , 29 % female ) , 141 ( 20 % ) were depressed , 466 ( 65 % ) non-depressed , and 108 ( 15 % ) PHQ-deniers .
RESULTS	The composite endpoint of mortality and re-hospitalization was neutral overall and in all subgroups .
RESULTS	However , HNC reduced mortality risk in both depressed and non-depressed patients [ adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs ) 0.12 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.03-0 .56 , P = 0.006 , and 0.49 , 95 % CI 0.25-0 .93 , P = 0.03 , respectively ] , but not in PHQ-deniers ( HR 1.74 , 95 % CI 0.77-3 .96 , P = 0.19 ; P = 0.006 for homogeneity of HRs ) .
RESULTS	Average frequencies of patient contacts in the HNC arm were 12.87.9 in non-depressed patients , 12.47.1 in depressed patients , and 5.57.2 in PHQ-deniers ( P < 0.001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Early after decompensation , HNC reduced mortality risk in non-depressed and even more in depressed subjects , but not in PHQ-deniers .
CONCLUSIONS	This suggests that differential acceptability and chance of success of care strategies such as HNC might be predicted by appropriate assessment of patients ' baseline characteristics including psychological disposition .
CONCLUSIONS	These post-hoc results should be reassessed by prospective evaluation of HNC in larger HF populations .

OBJECTIVE	Generalized anxiety and panic disorders are a burden on the society because they are costly and have a significant adverse effect on quality of life .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of a collaborative stepped care intervention for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder in primary care compared to care as usual from a societal perspective .
METHODS	The design of the study was a two armed cluster randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	In total 43 primary care practices in the Netherlands participated in the study .
METHODS	Eventually , 180 patients were included ( 114 collaborative stepped care , 66 care as usual ) .
METHODS	Baseline measures and follow-up measures ( 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months ) were assessed using questionnaires .
METHODS	We applied the TiC-P , the SF-HQL and the EQ-5D respectively measuring health care utilization , production losses and health related quality of life .
RESULTS	The average annual direct medical costs in the collaborative stepped care group were 1854 Euro ( 95 % C.I. , 1726 to 1986 ) compared to 1503 ( 95 % C.I. , 1374 to 1664 ) in the care as usual group .
RESULTS	The average quality of life years ( QALYs ) gained was 0.05 higher in the collaborative stepped care group , leading to an incremental cost effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) of 6965 Euro per QALY .
RESULTS	Inclusion of the productivity costs , consequently reflecting the full societal costs , decreased the ratio even more .
CONCLUSIONS	The study showed that collaborative stepped care was a cost effective intervention for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and was even dominant when a societal perspective was taken .

OBJECTIVE	Despite anecdotal reports of voice impairment in quadriplegia , the exact nature of these impairments is not well described in the literature .
OBJECTIVE	This article details objective and subjective voice assessments for people with quadriplegia at baseline and after a respiratory-targeted singing intervention .
METHODS	Randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Twenty-four participants with quadriplegia were randomly assigned to a 12-week program of either a singing intervention or active music therapy control .
METHODS	Recordings of singing and speech were made at baseline , 6 weeks , 12weeks , and 6 months postintervention .
METHODS	These deidentified recordings were used to measure sound pressure levels and assess voice quality using the Multidimensional Voice Profile and the Perceptual Voice Profile .
RESULTS	Baseline voice quality data indicated deviation from normality in the areas of breathiness , strain , and roughness .
RESULTS	A greater percentage of intervention participants moved toward more normal voice quality in terms of jitter , shimmer , and noise-to-harmonic ratio ; however , the improvements failed to achieve statistical significance .
CONCLUSIONS	Subjective and objective assessments of voice quality indicate that quadriplegia may have a detrimental effect on voice quality ; in particular , causing a perception of roughness and breathiness in the voice .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study suggest that singing training may have a role in ameliorating these voice impairments .

BACKGROUND	Medications to control intraocular pressure ( IOP ) are frequently preserved using benzalkonium chloride ( BAK ) , which can negatively affect the ocular surface .
BACKGROUND	Data are needed to assess efficacy and safety of prostaglandin drugs preserved with and without BAK .
BACKGROUND	The present study compared the efficacy and safety of BAK-free travoprost 0.004 % ( TRAV ) and BAK 0.02 % - preserved bimatoprost 0.01 % ( BIM ) during late-day time points in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension .
METHODS	This was a 12-week , phase 4 , randomized , investigator-masked , crossover study .
METHODS	84 patients with IOP 24 and < 36 mmHg were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily TRAV or BIM for 6 weeks followed by an additional 6-week crossover period .
METHODS	IOP was measured at the end of each treatment period at 4 , 6 , and 8 pm .
METHODS	TRAV was considered noninferior to BIM if the upper limit of the 95 % CI of the between-group difference in mean IOP was 1.5 mmHg .
METHODS	Adverse events were assessed throughout the study .
RESULTS	One patient discontinued due to allergic conjunctivitis , and 2 patients with missing data were excluded ; 81 patients were included in the per-protocol population ( mean SD age , 58.3 11.4 years ; TRAV/BIM , n = 41 ; BIM/TRAV , n = 40 ) .
RESULTS	After 6 weeks , mean IOP with TRAV ( 17.4 2.7 mmHg ; change from baseline , -6.0 mmHg ) was similar to BIM ( 17.2 2.6 mmHg ; change from baseline , -6.3 mmHg ) ; the between-group difference was 0.22 mmHg ( 95 % CI , -0.22 to 0.67 ) .
RESULTS	Thus , noninferiority of TRAV versus BIM was demonstrated .
RESULTS	Mean IOP at each time point and mean and percentage IOP change from baseline were not significantly different between treatments .
RESULTS	All treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate .
RESULTS	The incidences of mild ocular hyperemia with TRAV and BIM were 31 % and 39 % , respectively ; moderate hyperemia was observed in 2 % of patients receiving BIM .
CONCLUSIONS	Late-day IOP-lowering efficacy of BAK-free TRAV was noninferior to that of BAK 0.02 % - preserved BIM ; both reduced baseline IOP by 25 % .
CONCLUSIONS	Both treatments were well tolerated , although a higher incidence of moderate ocular hyperemia was observed with BIM .

OBJECTIVE	Most electronic health record ( EHR ) systems have the capability of generating a printed after-visit summary ( AVS ) , but there has been little research on optimal content .
OBJECTIVE	We conducted a qualitative study and a randomized trial to understand the effect of AVS content on patient recall and satisfaction .
METHODS	Adult primary care patients ( n = 272 ) with at least 1 chronic condition were randomly assigned to 4 AVS content conditions : minimum , intermediate , maximum , or standard AVS .
METHODS	Demographics and health literacy were measured at an index clinic visit .
METHODS	Recall and satisfaction were measured by telephone 2 days and 2 to 3 weeks after the clinic visit .
RESULTS	Average age was 52 years ; 75 % of patients were female , 61 % were Hispanic , and 21 % were African American , and 64 % had adequate health literacy .
RESULTS	Average medication recall accuracy was 53 % at 2 days and 52 % at 3 weeks , with no significant difference among groups at either time .
RESULTS	Satisfaction with AVS content was high and did not differ among groups .
RESULTS	Recall of specific content categories was low and unrelated to group assignment .
RESULTS	Health literacy was unrelated to recall and satisfaction .
CONCLUSIONS	Primary care patients like to receive an AVS , but the amount of information included does not affect content recall or satisfaction with the information .

BACKGROUND	Adequate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations , [ 25 ( OH ) D ] , are required for optimal bone health , and low levels are associated with chronic diseases .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether 41 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in vitamin D and calcium pathway genes ( GC , DHCR7 , CYP2R1 , CYP27B1 , CYP24A1 , VDR , and CASR ) are associated with [ 25 ( OH ) D ] or modify the increase in [ 25 ( OH ) D ] from vitamin D3 supplementation .
METHODS	Baseline and year 1 [ 25 ( OH ) D ] measurements from a randomized controlled trial conducted at 11 clinical centers in the United States .
METHODS	A total of 1787 healthy non-Hispanic white participants aged 45-75 years .
METHODS	Vitamin D3 ( 1000 IU/d ) , calcium carbonate ( 1200 mg/d elemental ) , both , or placebo .
METHODS	Genotype main effects and interactions with vitamin D3 treatment estimated using multiple linear regression .
RESULTS	The baseline serum [ 25 ( OH ) D ] was 25.4 8.7 ng/mL ( mean SD ) .
RESULTS	Associations with baseline levels were discovered for SNPs in CYP24A1 ( rs2209314 , rs2762939 ) and confirmed for SNPs in GC and CYP2R1 .
RESULTS	After 1 year , [ 25 ( OH ) D ] increased on average by 6.1 8.9 ng/mL on vitamin D3 treatment and decreased by 1.1 8.4 ng/mL on placebo .
RESULTS	The increase in [ 25 ( OH ) D ] due to vitamin D3 supplementation was modified by genotypes at rs10766197 near CYP2R1 , rs6013897 near CYP24A1 , and rs7968585 near VDR .
CONCLUSIONS	The increase in [ 25 ( OH ) D ] attributable to vitamin D3 supplementation may vary according to common genetic differences in vitamin D 25-hydroxylase ( CYP2R1 ) , 24-hydroxylase ( CYP24A1 ) , and the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) genes .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings have implications for achieving optimal vitamin D status and potentially for vitamin D-related health outcomes .

BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative pain levels after arthroscopic elbow surgery under general anesthesia and to determine whether an axillary nerve block provides additional pain management benefits compared with a portal site injection of local anesthetic .
METHODS	Thirty-six patients undergoing arthroscopic elbow surgery under general anesthesia were randomized to either a study group receiving axillary nerve block ( Ax group ) or a control group receiving portal site injections of local anesthetic ( Lo group ) .
METHODS	During the first 48 hours after surgery , pain visual analog scale ( VAS ) scores ( 0-100 ) , total amount of oral analgesics required , and patient satisfaction were assessed .
RESULTS	Among all 36 patients , mean pain VAS scores at rest were 37 , 18 , and 9 for the first 12-hour period and at 24 and 48 hours after surgery , respectively .
RESULTS	The mean pain VAS scores during physiotherapy were 47 and 33 at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively , respectively .
RESULTS	No intergroup differences were observed between the Ax and Lo groups at any time point after surgery ( P value range , .41 to .87 ) .
RESULTS	The mean number of loxoprofen tablets required during the 48-hour study period was 5.1 in the Ax group and 4.5 in the Lo group ( P = .90 ) .
RESULTS	The Ax and Lo groups had mean overall patient satisfaction scores of 91 and 91 , respectively ( P = .98 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Postoperative pain levels after arthroscopic elbow surgery could be well managed with oral analgesics and local anesthetic .
CONCLUSIONS	An axillary nerve block was not found to provide any postoperative pain control benefits .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the benefit of aerobic exercise on colonic transit time ( CTT ) for psychiatric inpatients in a closed ward .
METHODS	Sixty consecutive adult inpatients of the Somang Hospital Psychiatry Unit ( Eumsung-gun , South Korea ) , without CTT-related diseases or drug therapies , were recruited for study from March to June of 2012 .
METHODS	Upon enrollment , the patients were randomly assigned to partake in a 12-wk instructor-led group aerobic exercise program ( exercise group ; n = 30 ) or to maintain their ordinary daily activities ( control group ; n = 30 ) .
METHODS	The exercise program was structured as 10 min warm-up ( stretching ) , 40 min exercise , and 10 min cool-down ( stretching ) for three days each week .
METHODS	The exercise sessions consisted of walking only in week one and aerobics from weeks two to 12 , with increasing intensity ( 50 % heart rate reserve ( HRR ) for weeks one to four , 60 % HRR for weeks five to eight , and 70 % HRR for weeks nine to 12 ) .
METHODS	CTT was measured before ( baseline ) and after ( week 12 ) the exercise program , in duplicate ( on days four and seven ) , using abdominal radiography and the multiple radio-opaque marker technique .
METHODS	Changes in the exercising patients ' CTT and weight - , cardiovascular - and fitness-related parameters were statistically assessed .
RESULTS	The study dropout rate was 30.0 % , with 23 patients in the exercise group and 19 patients in the control group completing the study .
RESULTS	At week 12 , the exercise group showed decreases in body weight ( mean SE ) baseline : 69.4 2.8 vs study-end : 67.6 2.7 ; P < 0.635 ) and body mass index ( BMI ) ( 25.2 1.1 vs 24.9 0.8 ; P < 0.810 ) , but the extent of change was not significantly different from that experienced by the control group ( body weight : 68.8 4.0 vs 68.8 3.9 ; BMI : 24.3 1.1 vs 24.4 1.2 ) .
RESULTS	However , the exercise group showed significant improvements in leg muscle strength ( baseline : 41.7 4.3 vs study-end : 64.1 5.0 ; P < 0.001 ) , cardio-respiratory endurance ( 120.5 4.5 vs 105.4 2.8 ; P < 0.004 ) , and leg muscle elasticity and power output ( 21.5 2.6 vs 30.6 2.8 ; P < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	The exercise group showed an exercise-induced reduction in total CTT ( baseline : 54.2 8.0 vs 30.3 6.1 ) , which was significantly different from that experienced by the control group over the 12-wk period ( 48.6 9.3 vs 48.3 12.3 ; P = 0.027 ) ; however , the exercise-induced decreases in CTT involving the three colonic segments examined ( right , left and recto-sigmoid ) showed no significant differences from the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	A 12-wk aerobic exercise program can benefit psychiatric inpatients by increasing intestinal motility , possibly decreasing risk of metabolic - and cardiovascular-related disease .

OBJECTIVE	Reported rates of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are lower with glimepiride as compared to glyburide .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to determine whether physiologic differences in counterregulatory neuroendocrine and metabolic mechanisms during hypoglycemia provide a basis for the observed clinical differences between glimepiride and glyburide .
METHODS	Non-diabetic volunteers ( age 382years , BMI 261kg/m ( 2 ) ) were studied in a single-blind fashion during separate 2day randomized protocols consisting of 2h hyperinsulinemic ( 9pmol/kg/min ) euglycemic ( 4.90.1 mmol ) and hypoglycemic ( 2.90.1 mmol/L ) clamps .
METHODS	Individuals received biologically equivalent doses of glimepiride ( 4mg ) or glyburide ( 10mg ) 1h prior to each glucose clamp ( n = 11 ) as well as a control group of placebo studies .
METHODS	Glucose kinetics were calculated using D-Glucose-6-6d2 .
RESULTS	Insulin and C-peptide levels were increased ( p < 0.05 ) during euglycemia in both sulfonylurea groups as compared to placebo .
RESULTS	However , despite equivalent hypoglycemia , insulin and C-peptide levels were higher ( p < 0.05 ) only after glyburide .
RESULTS	Glucagon responses and endogenous glucose production ( EGP ) were decreased ( p < 0.05 ) during hypoglycemia following glyburide administration as compared to glimepiride .
RESULTS	Glyburide reduced ( p < 0.05 ) norepinephrine responses during euglycemic clamps .
RESULTS	In addition combined epinephrine and norepinephrine responses during hypoglycemia were reduced ( p < 0.05 ) following glyburide as compared to placebo .
RESULTS	Leptin levels fell by a greater amount ( p < 0.05 ) during hypoglycemia with both sulfonylureas as compared to placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	In summary , glimepiride and glyburide can both similarly increase insulin and C-peptide levels during hyperinsulinemic euglycemia .
CONCLUSIONS	However , during moderate hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia ( 2.9 mmol/L ) glyburide resulted in increased C-peptide and insulin , but blunted glucagon , sympathetic nervous system and EGP responses .
CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that glyburide can acutely reduce key neuroendocrine and metabolic counterregulatory defenses during hypoglycemia in healthy individuals .

BACKGROUND	Tobramycin inhalation is an accepted treatment of chronic pseudomonal infection in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients .
BACKGROUND	Twice daily inhalation is efficacious , but time-consuming .
METHODS	In this randomized , open-label , multicentre , two-period , crossover study , 58 patients with CF and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) infection received two tobramycin nebuliser solutions : T100/eFlow or TNS/PARI LC PLUS .
METHODS	The primary objective was to demonstrate the equivalence of both treatments with respect to pharmacokinetics ( area under the concentration-time curve and maximum concentration in plasma ) .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints were tobramycin sputum pharmacokinetics , reduction in PA colony forming units , improvement of lung function , incidence of adverse drug reactions and reduction of inhalation times .
RESULTS	Tobramycin plasma AUC and Cmax were lower after administration of T100 than after TNS .
RESULTS	The study failed to demonstrate systemic bioequivalence of the two treatments .
RESULTS	After T100 administration , tobramycin sputum AUC and Cmax achieved higher values than after TNS .
RESULTS	Changes in efficacy parameters from baseline were similar .
RESULTS	Safety profiles were not different or unexpected .
RESULTS	Inhalation time per inhalation was shorter during treatment with T100 .
CONCLUSIONS	The lower systemic drug burden and the higher local drug deposition together with a comparable efficacy/safety profile and a shorter inhalation time render T100/eFlow an attractive treatment option for CF patients .
CONCLUSIONS	( www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN85410458 ) .

OBJECTIVE	Luseogliflozin is a novel sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) treatment .
OBJECTIVE	An exploratory Phase II study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of several doses of luseogliflozin in Japanese T2DM patients .
METHODS	Japanese T2DM patients aged 20-74 years with hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) of 6.9-10 .5 % , fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) 126mg/dL and on diet therapy were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive luseogliflozin ( 0.5 , 2.5 , or 5mg ) or placebo once daily for 12 weeks ( n = 61 , 61 , 61 , and 56 , respectively ) .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to end of treatment .
METHODS	Other endpoints included FPG , 2h postprandial plasma glucose ( PPG ) in a meal tolerance test ( MTT ) , and body weight .
METHODS	Drug safety was also assessed .
BACKGROUND	Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center ( identifier : JapicCTI-090908 ) .
RESULTS	Changes in HbA1c from baseline to end of treatment were -0.36 , -0.62 , and -0.75 % in the 0.5 , 2.5 , and 5mg luseogliflozin groups , respectively , versus +0.06 % in the placebo group ( all P < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	The reductions in FPG and 2h-PPG in the MTT were also significantly greater in the luseogliflozin groups ( all P < 0.01 ) without increases in insulin levels from baseline .
RESULTS	Luseogliflozin reduced body weight at all doses .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in the incidences of adverse events among groups .
RESULTS	Most adverse events were mild in severity .
RESULTS	There were no serious adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	Although this was a small-scale study with a short duration , all tested doses of luseogliflozin significantly improved glycemic control , reduced body weight , and were well tolerated in Japanese T2DM patients over the 12-week treatment period .

OBJECTIVE	Short-term blood pressure variability ( BPV ) may predict outcome in acute stroke .
OBJECTIVE	We undertook a post hoc analysis of data from 2 randomized controlled trials to determine the effect of short-term BPV on 2-week outcome .
METHODS	Controlling Hypertension and Hypotension Immediately Post Stroke ( CHHIPS ) was a trial of BP-lowering , enrolling 179 acute stroke patients ( onset < 36 hours ) .
METHODS	Continue or Stop Post-Stroke Antihypertensives Collaborative Study ( COSSACS ) compared a strategy of continuation versus temporarily stopping prestroke antihypertensive therapy in 763 acute stroke patients ( onset < 48 hours ) .
METHODS	BPV at baseline ( defined as SD , coefficient of variation , variation independent of the mean , and average real variability ) was derived from standardized casual cuff BP measures ( 6 readings < 30 minutes ) .
METHODS	Adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess the relation between BPV and death and disability ( modified Rankin scale > 3 ) at 2 weeks .
RESULTS	Seven hundred six ( 92.5 % ) and 171 ( 95.5 % ) participants were included in the analysis for the COSSACS and CHHIPS data sets , respectively .
RESULTS	Adjusted logistic regression analyses revealed no statistically significant associations between any of the included BPV parameters with 2-week death or disability in either study data set : COSSACS , odds ratio SD systolic BP 0.98 ( 0.78-1 .23 ) ; CHHIPS , odds ratio SD systolic BP 0.97 ( 0.90-1 .11 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	When derived from casual cuff BP measures , short-term BPV is not a useful predictor of early ( 2 weeks ) outcome after acute stroke .
CONCLUSIONS	Differing methodology may account for the discordance with previous studies indicating long-term ( casual BPV ) and short-term ( beat-to-beat BPV ) prognostic value .

BACKGROUND	Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality during open-heart surgery .
BACKGROUND	Up to 60 % of intraoperative cerebral events are emboli induced .
BACKGROUND	This randomized , controlled , multicenter trial is the first human study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a novel aortic cannula producing simultaneous forward flow and backward suction for extracting solid and gaseous emboli from the ascending aorta and aortic arch upon their intraoperative release .
METHODS	Sixty-six patients ( 25 females ; 6810 years ) undergoing elective aortic valve replacement surgery , with or without coronary artery bypass graft surgery , were randomized to the use of the CardioGard ( CardioGard Medical , Or-Yehuda , Israel ) Emboli Protection cannula ( `` treatment '' ) or a standard ( `` control '' ) aortic cannula .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the volume of new brain lesions measured by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DW-MRI ) , performed preoperatively and postoperatively .
METHODS	Device safety was investigated by comparisons of complications rate , namely neurologic events , stroke , renal insufficiency and death .
RESULTS	Of 66 patients ( 34 in the treatment group ) , 51 completed the presurgery and postsurgery MRI ( 27 in the treatment group ) .
RESULTS	The volume of new brain lesion for the treatment group was ( meanstandard error of the mean ) 44.0064.00 versus 126.5628.74 mm3 in the control group ( p = 0.004 ) .
RESULTS	Of the treatment group , 41 % demonstrated new postoperative lesions versus 66 % in the control group ( p = 0.03 ) .
RESULTS	The complication rate was comparable in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The CardioGard cannula is safe and efficient in use during open-heart surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	Efficacy was demonstrated by the removal of a substantial amount of emboli , a significant reduction in the volume of new brain lesions , and the percentage of patients experiencing new brain lesions .

BACKGROUND	The skills and knowledge that residents have to master has increased , yet the amount of hours that the residents are allowed to work has been reduced .
BACKGROUND	There is a strong need to improve training techniques to compensate for these changes .
BACKGROUND	One approach is to use simulation-training methods to shorten the learning curve for surgeons in training .
OBJECTIVE	To analyze the effect of surgical training using three-dimensional ( 3D ) simulation on the placement of lateral mass screws in the cervical spine on either cadavers or sawbones .
METHODS	A blinded randomized control study .
METHODS	Fifteen orthopedic residents , postgraduate year ( PGY ) 1 to 6 , were asked to simulate Magerl lateral mass screw trajectories from C3-C7 on cadavers using a navigated drill guide , but with no feedback as to the actual trajectory within the bone ( Baseline 1 ) .
METHODS	This was repeated to determine baseline accuracy ( Baseline 2 ) .
METHODS	They were then randomized into three groups : Group 1 , control , did not receive any training , whereas Groups 2 and 3 received 3D navigational feedback as to the intended drill trajectory on sawbones and cadavers , respectively .
METHODS	All three groups then performed final simulated drilling ( final test ) .
METHODS	All 3D images were deidentified and reviewed by a blinded single fellowship-trained orthopedic spine surgeon .
METHODS	Each image/screw was measured for the starting site , caudad/cephalad angle , and medial/lateral angle to determine trajectory accuracy .
RESULTS	The aggregate mean difference from a perfect screw was compiled for each session for each group .
RESULTS	A negative difference shows improvement , whereas a positive difference shows regression .
RESULTS	The difference between final test and Baseline 1 in the control group was 2.4 , suggesting regression .
RESULTS	In contrast , the differences for groups sawbone and cadaver were -8.2 and -7.2 , respectively , suggesting improvement .
RESULTS	When comparing the difference in aggregate sum angle for the sawbones and cadaver groups with the control group , the difference was statistically significant ( p < .0001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Training with 3D navigation significantly improved the ability of orthopedic residents to properly drill simulated lateral mass screws .
CONCLUSIONS	As such , training with 3D navigation may be a useful adjunct in resident surgical education .

OBJECTIVE	Anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches are considered for the management of type 2 diabetes and for the prevention of its complications .
OBJECTIVE	There is limited evidence regarding the effects of prebiotics on inflammation , especially in patients with type 2 diabetes .
OBJECTIVE	This trial aims to examine the effects of oligofructose-enriched inulin on glycemic status , inflammation markers , and metabolic endotoxemia in female patients .
METHODS	Over a period of 8 wk , 52 women with body mass indices of > 25 kg/m ( 2 ) but < 35 kg/m ( 2 ) with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either an intervention group , in which participants were given oligofructose-enriched inulin ( n = 27 , consuming 10 g/d of oligofructose-enriched inulin ) , or to a control group , in which participants were given maltodextrin ( n = 25 , consuming 10 g/d of maltodextrin ) .
METHODS	Fasting plasma glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , interleukin-6 , tumor necrosis factor - , interferon - , interleukin-10 , and plasma lipopolysaccharide were measured before and after the intervention .
METHODS	Data were analyzed with the use of SPSS software version 13 .
METHODS	Paired and unpaired Student t tests and analysis of covariance were used to compare quantitative variables .
RESULTS	Oligofructose-enriched inulin caused a significant decrease in the levels of fasting plasma glucose ( 19.2 mg/dL ; 9.50 % ) , glycosylated hemoglobin ( 1.0 % ; 8.40 % ) , interleukin-6 ( 1.3 pg/mL ; 8.15 % ) , tumor necrosis factor - ( 3.0 pg/mL ; 19.80 % ) and plasma lipopolysaccharide ( 6.0 EU/mL ; 21.95 % ) as compared with maltodextrin ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	Decreases in levels of interferon - ( 0.3 pg/mL ; 16.50 % ) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( 3.9 ng/mL ; 31.70 % ) and an increase in the level of interleukin-10 ( 0.4 pg/mL , 11.50 % ) were not significant in the oligofructose-enriched inulin group as compared with the maltodextrin group .
CONCLUSIONS	In women with type 2 diabetes and suboptimal daily dietary fiber intake , oligofructose-enriched inulin may help to modulate some inflammatory markers .

BACKGROUND	Interventions that make extensive use of theory tend to have larger effects on behaviour .
BACKGROUND	The Intervention Mapping ( IM ) framework incorporates theory into intervention design , implementation and evaluation , and was applied to the development of a community-based childhood obesity prevention intervention for a multi-ethnic population .
METHODS	IM was applied as follows : 1 ) Needs assessment of the community and culture ; consideration of evidence-base , policy and practice ; 2 ) Identification of desired outcomes and change objectives following identification of barriers to behaviour change mapped alongside psychological determinants ( e.g. knowledge , self-efficacy , intention ) ; 3 ) Selection of theory-based methods and practical applications to address barriers to behaviour change ( e.g. , strategies for responsive feeding ) ; 4 ) Design of the intervention by developing evidence-based interactive activities and resources ( e.g. , visual aids to show babies stomach size ) .
METHODS	The activities were integrated into an existing parenting programme ; 5 ) Adoption and implementation : parenting practitioners were trained by healthcare professionals to deliver the programme within Children Centres .
RESULTS	HAPPY ( Healthy and Active Parenting Programme for Early Years ) is aimed at overweight and obese pregnant women ( BMI > 25 ) ; consists of 12 2.5 hr .
RESULTS	sessions ( 6 ante-natal from 24weeks ; 6 postnatal up to 9months ) ; it addresses mother 's diet and physical activity , breast or bottle feeding , infant diet and parental feeding practices , and infant physical activity .
CONCLUSIONS	We have demonstrated that IM is a feasible and helpful method for providing an evidence based and theoretical structure to a complex health behaviour change intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	The next stage will be to assess the impact of the intervention on behaviour change and clinical factors associated with childhood obesity .
CONCLUSIONS	The HAPPY programme is currently being tested as part of a randomised controlled feasibility trial .

BACKGROUND	Cardiac surgery has been shown to result in a significant decrease of the antioxidant selenium , which is associated with the development of multiorgan dysfunction and increased mortality .
BACKGROUND	Thus , a large-scale study is needed to investigate the effect of perioperative selenium supplementation on the occurrence of postoperative organ dysfunction .
METHODS	We plan a prospective , randomized double-blind , multicenter controlled trial , which will be conducted in North and South America and in Europe .
METHODS	In this trial we will include 1,400 high-risk patients , who are most likely to benefit from selenium supplementation .
METHODS	This includes patients scheduled for non-emergent combined and/or complex procedures , or with a predicted operative mortality of 5 % according to the EuroSCORE II .
METHODS	Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group ( bolus infusion of 2,000 g sodium selenite immediately prior to surgery , followed by an additional dosage of 2,000 g at ICU admission , and a further daily supplementation of 1,000 g up to 10 days or ICU discharge ) or to the control group ( placebo administration at the same time points ) .
METHODS	The primary endpoint of this study is a composite of ` persistent organ dysfunction ' ( POD ) and/or death within 30 days from surgery ( POD + death ) .
METHODS	POD is defined as any need for life-sustaining therapies ( mechanical ventilation , vasopressor therapy , mechanical circulatory support , continuous renal replacement therapy , or new intermittent hemodialysis ) at any time within 30 days from surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	The SUSTAIN-CSX study is a multicenter trial to investigate the effect of a perioperative high dosage sodium selenite supplementation in high-risk cardiac surgical patients .

BACKGROUND	Heart failure ( HF ) disproportionately affects Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders ( NHOPIs ) .
BACKGROUND	This study examines risk factors associated with left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) among 151 hospitalized NHOPI HF patients enrolled at a single tertiary care hospital between June 2006 and April 2010 .
METHODS	Enrollment criteria : ( 1 ) NHOPI by self-identification .
METHODS	( 2 ) Age 21 yrs .
METHODS	( 3 ) Diagnosis of HF defined : ( a ) left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) 40 % or LVEF 60 % with abnormal diastolic function and ( b ) classic HF signs/symptoms .
METHODS	LVEF was measured by echocardiography within 6 weeks of hospitalization .
METHODS	Clinical measures , medical history , and questionnaires were assessed using standardized protocols .
METHODS	Linear regression modeling was used to examine the association of significant correlates of LVEF , which were then included en bloc into the final model .
METHODS	A P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant .
RESULTS	Of 151 participants , 69 % were men , mean age 54.3 13.5 years , blood pressure 112 20/69 15 mmHg , and body mass index ( BMI ) 36.9 9 kg/m ( 2 ) .
RESULTS	Twenty-five percent of participants were smokers , 45 % used alcohol and 23 % reported a history of methamphetamine use .
RESULTS	Clinically , 72 % had hypertension , 49 % were diabetic and 37 % had a prior myocardial infarction .
RESULTS	Nearly 60 % had moderate to severe LVEF ( < 35 % ) .
RESULTS	Higher LVEF was independently associated with female sex and greater BMI ( P < .04 ) while pacemaker/defibrillator and methamphetamine use was independently associated with lower LVEF ( P < .05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Methamphetamine use and BMI may be important modifiable risk factors associated with LVEF and may be important targets for improving HF morbidity and mortality .

OBJECTIVE	The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of doula support on first-trimester abortion care .
METHODS	Women were randomized to receive doula support or routine care during first-trimester surgical abortion .
METHODS	We examined the effect of doula support on pain during abortion using a 100 mm visual analog scale .
METHODS	The study had the statistical power to detect a 20 % difference in mean pain scores .
METHODS	Secondary measures included satisfaction , procedure duration , and patient recommendations regarding doula support .
RESULTS	Two hundred fourteen women completed the study : 106 received doula support , and 108 received routine care .
RESULTS	The groups did not differ regarding demographics , gestational age , or medical history .
RESULTS	Pain scores in the doula and control groups did not differ at speculum insertion ( 38.6 [ 26.3 mm ] vs 43.6 mm [ 25.9 mm ] , P = .18 ) or procedure completion ( 68.2 [ 28.0 mm ] vs 70.6 mm [ 23.5 mm ] , P = .52 ) .
RESULTS	Procedure duration ( 3.39 [ 2.83 min ] vs 3.18 min [ 2.36 min ] , P = .55 ) and patient satisfaction ( 75.2 [ 28.6 mm ] vs 74.6 mm [ 27.4 mm ] , P = .89 ) did not differ between the doula and control groups .
RESULTS	Among women who received doula support , 96.2 % recommended routine doula support for abortion and 60.4 % indicated interest in training as doulas .
RESULTS	Among women who did not receive doula support , 71.6 % of women would have wanted it .
RESULTS	Additional clinical staff was needed to provide support for 2.9 % of women in the doula group and 14.7 % of controls ( P < .01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although doula support did not have a measurable effect on pain or satisfaction , women overwhelmingly recommended it for routine care .
CONCLUSIONS	Women receiving doula support were less likely to require additional clinic support resources .
CONCLUSIONS	Doula support therefore may address patient psychosocial needs .

OBJECTIVE	The incidence of propofol injection pain during induction of general anesthesia varies from 28 % to 90 % .
OBJECTIVE	This prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluated the effect of dexmedetomidine ( DEX ) for reducing the incidence and severity of propofol injection pain .
METHODS	Patients undergoing elective surgical procedures were randomly allocated into seven groups of 30 patients each .
METHODS	Experimental treatments were intravenously administered over 10 min ( total volume 10 mL ) prior to intravenous propofol injection , as follows : group I , the control group , was given isotonic saline .
METHODS	Patients in groups II , III , and IV received DEX 0.25 g/kg , 0.5 g/kg , or 1.0 g/kg , respectively , mixed with isotonic saline immediately before propofol injection .
METHODS	Patients in groups V , VI , and VII received DEX as above , but 5 minutes before propofol injection .
METHODS	Propofol consisted of 1 % long-chain triglyceride propofol ( 2.5 mg/kg ) injected at 1 mL/s .
RESULTS	Median propofol injection pain score was 0.00 ( IQR 0.00-3 .00 ) in patients who received 1.0 g/kg DEX 5 min before the propofol injection ( group VII ) , and only 1 patient ( of 30 ) in this group received a pain score > 2 .
RESULTS	The median pain score and number of patients with pain scores > 2 in group VII were both significantly less than in the control ( group I ; p = 0.000 , both ) .
RESULTS	There were no differences in either mean arterial pressure or heart rate at any time point after DEX injection among the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Pretreatment with intravenous DEX 1 g/kg 5 min prior to injection of long-chain triglyceride propofol is effective and safe in reducing the incidence and severity of pain due to propofol injection .

BACKGROUND	The Combined Approach to Lysis Utilizing Eptifibatide and Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator ( rt-PA ) in Acute Ischemic Stroke-Enhanced Regimen ( CLEAR-ER ) trial found that intravenous rt-PA plus eptifibatide ( combination arm ) in acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) was safe and had a direction of effect that would justify a phase III trial .
BACKGROUND	CLEAR-ER had unanticipated imbalances between treatment groups .
BACKGROUND	We compared the rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage ( sICH ) and good outcomes for combination therapy patients in the CLEAR-ER trial to a matched cohort of rt-PA patients from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ( NINDS ) trial .
METHODS	CLEAR-ER was a multicenter , double-blind , randomized study ; rt-PA-eligible AIS patients were randomized to .6 mg/kg rt-PA plus eptifibatide ( 135 mcg/kg bolus and .75 mcg/kg/min two-hour infusion ) versus standard rt-PA ( .9 mg/kg ) .
METHODS	For this analysis , we matched 1:1 CLEAR-ER combination therapy patients with rt-PA arm NINDS trial patients .
METHODS	Patients were matched by age , gender , race , baseline modified Rankin Scale score , baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score , and stroke onset to rt-PA time .
RESULTS	Fifty-four matches were made .
RESULTS	One ( 1.8 % ) sICH occurred in each group ( odds ratio [ OR ] 1.00 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] .01 -78.50 ) .
RESULTS	At 90days , 51.8 % of the CLEAR-ER group had good outcomes versus 46.3 % in the NINDS rt-PA group ( OR 1.30 , 95 % CI .57 -2.96 ) .
RESULTS	For subjects with baseline NIHSS score > 12 ( CLEAR-ER median NIHSS score ) , 38.5 % of the CLEAR-ER group had good outcomes versus 23.1 % in the NINDS group ( OR 2.33 , 95 % CI .60 -9.02 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The safety and direction of effect of eptifibatide plus rt-PA were confirmed .
CONCLUSIONS	A phase III trial is needed to determine the efficacy of eptifibatide plus rt-PA for improving long-term outcomes after AIS .

OBJECTIVE	We explore gender differences in older adults ' appraisals of positive and negative aspects of their marriages , examine how these appraisals relate to global marital satisfaction , and identify distinctive marital profiles associated with global satisfaction in men and women .
METHODS	Data are from the Changing Lives of Older Couples Study ( n = 1,110 ) .
METHODS	We used a variant of principal components analysis to generate marital quality profiles , based on one 's endorsement of positive and negative marital characteristics .
METHODS	OLS regression was used to detect associations between marital profiles and global marital satisfaction .
RESULTS	Men offered more positive marital assessments than women , particularly on items reflecting positive treatment by one 's wife .
RESULTS	Three marital quality profiles emerged : Positive , Positive-Negative , and Negative .
RESULTS	Although marital satisfaction was best explained by positive appraisals in both genders , they were less important for men than for women .
RESULTS	The negative profile showed a tendency for a stronger prediction in men .
CONCLUSIONS	Prior studies show small differences in men 's and women 's global marital satisfaction .
CONCLUSIONS	Our work provides evidence that the presence and magnitude of such gender differences may vary based on the specific marital component considered .
CONCLUSIONS	We discuss ways that gender shapes marital interactions , expectations , and perceptions , and the implications of our results for the well-being of married older adults .

BACKGROUND	Ward rounds represent an important task in clinical settings .
BACKGROUND	Despite their importance , students show substantial deficits in ward round competencies ( e.g. physical examination , drug prescription , documentation ) .
BACKGROUND	Previously reported teaching methods such as ward round training with standardized patients or educational wards , however , are time-consuming and expensive .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the effects of a structured on-ward supervision program for final-year students with specially trained supervising doctors focusing on ward round competencies .
METHODS	A total of 36 medical students were randomly assigned to an intervention group ( IG ) and a control group ( CG ) .
METHODS	During an eight-week-long training course , the intervention group ( IG ; n = 18 ) received structured ward round training while the control group ( CG ; n = 18 ) received on-ward training regarding how to take patient histories and perform physical examinations .
METHODS	Ward round competencies were assessed using simulated ward round scenarios with objective checklist ratings and standardized patient ratings .
RESULTS	The IG achieved significantly more predefined learning goals compared to the CG .
RESULTS	Standardized patient ratings did not differ significantly between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	RESULTS provide evidence that the presented program is a feasible and efficient tool for teaching ward round skills at the bedside .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research should focus on cost effectiveness compared to alternative models .

BACKGROUND	Performance of transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) requires the psychomotor ability to obtain interpretable echocardiographic images .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a simulation-based curriculum in which a TEE simulator is used to teach the psychomotor skills to novice echocardiographers and to compare instructor-guided with self-directed online delivery of the curriculum .
METHODS	After institutional review board approval , subjects inexperienced in TEE completed an online review of TEE material prior to a baseline pre-test of TEE psychomotor skills using the simulator .
METHODS	Subjects were randomized to two groups .
METHODS	The first group received an instructor-guided lesson of TEE psychomotor skills with the simulator .
METHODS	The second group received a self-directed slide presentation of TEE psychomotor skills with the simulator .
METHODS	Both lessons delivered identical information .
METHODS	Following their respective training sessions , all subjects performed a post-test of their TEE psychomotor skills using the simulator .
METHODS	Two assessors rated the TEE performances using a validated scoring system for acquisition of images .
RESULTS	Pre-test TEE simulator scores were similar between the two instruction groups ( 9.0 vs 5.0 ; P = 0.28 ) .
RESULTS	The scores in both groups improved significantly following training , regardless of the method of instruction ( P < 0.0001 ) .
RESULTS	The improvement in scores ( post-test scores minus pre-test scores ) did not differ significantly between instruction groups ( 12.5 vs 14.5 ; P = 0.55 ) .
RESULTS	There was strong inter-rater reliability between assessors ( = 0.98 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.97 to 0.99 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	High-fidelity TEE simulators are an effective training adjunct for the acquisition of basic TEE psychomotor skills .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no difference in improvement between the different modalities of instruction .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research will examine the need for a faculty resource for a curriculum in which a simulator is used as an adjunct .

BACKGROUND	Complications due to hemodilution ( hematocrit value less than 22 % ) after cardiopulmonary bypass inevitably resulted with significantly greater intensive care requirements , long hospital stays , more operative costs , and increased mortality rates .
BACKGROUND	We tried to identify whether crystalloid cardioplegia is the strongest predictor of intraoperative hemodilution or not .
METHODS	One hundred patients were included into this randomized prospective study .
METHODS	Patients were divided into the two groups .
METHODS	Crystalloid cardioplegia were given to the odd-numbered patients ( Group 1 , n = 50 patients ) and blood cardioplegia were given to the even-numbered patients ( Group 2 , n = 50 patients ) .
METHODS	St. Thomas-II solution was used in Group-1 and Calafiore cold blood cardioplegia was in Group-2 .
RESULTS	Average intraoperative hematocrit value was 18.4 % 2.3 in crystalloid group 24.2 % 3.4 in blood cardioplegia group ( p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	The lowest hematocrit value was 15 % and 20 % in two groups respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	In crystalloid group average intraoperative packed red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion was 2.3 0.41 units , 0.7 0.6 units blood cardioplegia group ( p = 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	Average transfused RBC was 2.7 0.8 units in crystalloid group , 0.9 0.4 units blood cardioplegia group ( p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	Multivariate analyses confirmed age ( p = 0.005 , OR = 3.78 ) , female gender ( p = 0.003 , OR = 2.91 ) , longer cross-clamp time ( > 60 minutes ) ( p = 0.001 , OD = 0.97 ) , body surface area < 1.6 m2 ( p = 0.001 , OR = 6.01 ) and crystalloid cardioplegia ( p < 0.001 , OR = 0.19 ) as predictor of intraoperative hemodilution .
CONCLUSIONS	Crystalloid cardioplegia , compared to blood cardioplegia not only causes much more intra-operative hemodilution but also increases the blood transfusion requirement .
CONCLUSIONS	Hemodilution and increased transfusion increases the intensive care unit and hospital stay , in the early postoperative period .

BACKGROUND	High phytate ( HP ) consumption is a concern in developing countries because of the high prevalence of iron deficiency in these countries .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether habitual consumption of an HP diet reduces the inhibitory effect of phytate on nonheme-iron absorption .
METHODS	Thirty-two nonanemic females , 18-35 y of age , with normal body mass index but with suboptimal iron stores ( serum ferritin , 30 g/L ) , were matched for serum ferritin concentration and randomly assigned to HP and low-phytate ( LP ) groups , in a parallel design study .
METHODS	Each subject consumed HP or LP foods with at least 2 of their daily meals for 8 wk , resulting in a change in phytate intake ( from 718 to 1190 mg/d in the HP group and 623 to 385 mg/d in the LP group ) .
METHODS	The serum iron response over 4 h after a test meal containing 350 mg of phytate was measured at baseline and postintervention .
METHODS	Ferritin , transferrin receptor , and hepcidin concentrations were measured at baseline and 8 wk .
RESULTS	Twenty-eight subjects completed the study ( n = 14 per group ) .
RESULTS	The serum iron response to the test meal increased in the HP group at postintervention , resulting in a 41 % increase in the area under the curve ( AUC ; P < 0.0001 ) .
RESULTS	However , no effect was observed in the LP group ( 21 % decrease in AUC ; P = 0.76 ) .
RESULTS	The postintervention serum iron response was lower ( P < 0.0001 ) in the LP group than in the HP group after controlling for the baseline serum iron response and hepcidin concentration , reflecting in a 64 % lower AUC .
CONCLUSIONS	We found that habitual consumption of an HP diet can reduce the negative effect of phytate on nonheme-iron absorption among young women with suboptimal iron stores .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies are needed to explore possible mechanisms .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02370940 .

BACKGROUND	The realization of the prostatic biopsies is a painful act .
BACKGROUND	The objective of our work was to compare the analgesic efficiency of the injection of the lidocaine at the level of periprostatics laterals and apical areas compared with the use of gel of lidocaine intrarectal associated with the taking of oral tramadol .
METHODS	Between November 2007 and December 2009 , 60 patients admitted in the service of urology of the university hospital Mohammed VI of Marrakesh for prostatic biopsies were randomized in two groups .
METHODS	The group 1 ( 30 patients ) received two tablets from tramadol 50mg with 10 mL of gel of lidocaine 2 % intrarectal while 30 patients of the group 2 received 10 mL from lidocaine 2 % injected at the level of periprostatics laterals and apicales .
METHODS	The pain was estimated by a visual analog scale ( AVS ) at the introduction of the probe of echography ( AVS 1 ) , at the time of the biopsy ( AVS 2 ) and 20 minutes later ( AVS 3 ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between both groups concerning AVS 1 means .
RESULTS	The average score of the pain was significantly lower in the group 2 for the AVS 2 and AVS 3 .
CONCLUSIONS	The periprostatics anesthesia assured a better control of the pain at the time of the prostatic biopsy and 20 minutes later , without increase of the complications .
CONCLUSIONS	We recommend it to decrease the pain and the discomfort related to this technique .

OBJECTIVE	Rasagiline is a selective , irreversible monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor , developed for the treatment of Parkinson 's disease .
OBJECTIVE	In compliance with current regulatory requirements , rasagiline underwent a thorough QT/QTc ( TQT ) study to assess its potential to prolong cardiac repolarization .
OBJECTIVE	The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of clinical ( 1 mg/day ) and supratherapeutic ( 2 mg/day and 6 mg/day ) multiple oral doses of rasagiline on the baseline - and placebo-adjusted QTc interval ( delta delta QTc ( ddQTc ) ) .
OBJECTIVE	Other electrocardiogram parameters , pharmacokinetic assessments , safety and tolerability as well as vital signs were investigated .
METHODS	This was a five-arm , randomized , double-blind , placebo - and active-controlled , and parallel study in healthy subjects .
METHODS	Moxifloxacin ( 400 mg ) positive control was included to demonstrate assay sensitivity .
RESULTS	247 of 250 randomized subjects completed the study .
RESULTS	Time-matched analysis of ddQTc yielded two-sided 90 % confidence intervals for all rasagiline doses below the 10 ms regulatory threshold , showing no effect on cardiac repolarization .
RESULTS	Concentration-effect analysis demonstrated no relationships between rasagiline ( and its metabolite 1-aminoindan ) , plasma concentrations , and ddQTc .
RESULTS	The pharmacokinetic profile of rasagiline was consistent with previous studies .
RESULTS	Adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity and were similar across all treatment groups .
RESULTS	There were no clinically significant changes in heart rate and systolic blood pressure .
CONCLUSIONS	This TQT study demonstrated a favorable cardiac safety profile of rasagiline .

BACKGROUND	Credible measures of disease incidence , trends and mortality can be obtained through surveillance using manual chart review , but this is both time-consuming and expensive .
BACKGROUND	ICD-10 discharge diagnoses are used as surrogate markers of infection , but knowledge on the validity of infections in general is sparse .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the study was to determine how well ICD-10 discharge diagnoses identify patients with community-acquired infections in a medical emergency department ( ED ) , overall and related to sites of infection and patient characteristics .
METHODS	We manually reviewed 5977 patients admitted to a medical ED in a one-year period ( September 2010-August 2011 ) , to establish if they were hospitalised with community-acquired infection .
METHODS	Using the manual review as gold standard , we calculated the sensitivity , specificity , predictive values , and likelihood ratios of discharge diagnoses indicating infection .
RESULTS	Two thousand five hundred eleven patients were identified with community-acquired infection according to chart review ( 42.0 % , 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % CI ] : 40.8-43 .3 % ) compared to 2550 patients identified by ICD-10 diagnoses ( 42.8 % , 95 % CI : 41.6-44 .1 % ) .
RESULTS	Sensitivity of the ICD-10 diagnoses was 79.9 % ( 95 % CI : 78.1-81 .3 % ) , specificity 83.9 % ( 95 % CI : 82.6-85 .1 % ) , positive likelihood ratio 4.95 ( 95 % CI : 4.58-5 .36 ) and negative likelihood ratio 0.24 ( 95 % CI : 0.22-0 .26 ) .
RESULTS	The two most common sites of infection , the lower respiratory tract and urinary tract , had positive likelihood ratios of 8.3 ( 95 % CI : 7.5-9 .2 ) and 11.3 ( 95 % CI : 10.2-12 .9 ) respectively .
RESULTS	We identified significant variation in diagnostic validity related to age , comorbidity and disease severity .
CONCLUSIONS	ICD-10 discharge diagnoses identify specific sites of infection with a high degree of validity , but only a moderate degree when identifying infections in general .

BACKGROUND	The affect of the kidneys in elimination and degradation of intact incretin hormones and their truncated metabolites is unclear .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate elimination and degradation of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) and glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) in patients with dialysis-dependent kidney failure .
METHODS	Twelve non-diabetic patients treated with chronic hemodialysis and 12 control subjects were examined in a double-blind , randomized , matched observational study at the Department of Nephrology , Rigshospitalet , University of Copenhagen , Denmark .
METHODS	Over 4 separate study days , synthetic human GIP or GLP-1 was infused with or without concurrent inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 using sitagliptin or placebo .
METHODS	Plasma concentrations of glucose , insulin , glucagon , and intact and total forms of GLP-1 or GIP were measured repeatedly .
METHODS	Plasma half-life ( T1/2 ) , metabolic clearance rate ( MCR ) , area under curve , and volume of distribution for intact and metabolite levels of GLP-1 and GIP were calculated .
RESULTS	Fasting concentrations of intact GLP-1 and GIP were increased in dialysis patients ( P < .001 ) whereas fasting levels of GLP-1 and GIP metabolites did not differ between groups ( P > .738 ) .
RESULTS	MCRs of intact GLP-1 and GIP , and the GLP-1 metabolite were reduced in dialysis patients on the placebo day ( P < .009 ) , and T1/2 of intact and metabolite forms of GLP-1 and GIP were comparable between groups ( P > .121 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Unexpectedly , degradation and elimination of the intact and metabolite forms of GLP-1 and GIP seemed preserved , although reduced , in patients with dialysis-dependent kidney failure .

OBJECTIVE	To explore the effects of combined intervention with education and progressive muscle relaxation ( PMR ) on quality of life ( QoL ) , functional disability , and positive symptoms of patients with acute schizophrenia .
METHODS	This randomized controlled study took place in an acute schizophrenia ward in Changsha , China .
METHODS	Sixty-four patients with acute schizophrenia were randomly assigned to four groups : control , education , PMR , and education plus PMR .
METHODS	QoL was assessed with the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form .
METHODS	Functional disability was assessed with the Sheehan Disability Scale .
METHODS	Severity of positive schizophrenia symptoms was assessed with the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms .
METHODS	All patients were evaluated at baseline ( within 72 hours before the interventions ) and at the end of weeks 5 ( when the interventions ended ) and week 15 ( a 10-week follow-up after the interventions ) .
RESULTS	The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of all four study groups were similar at baseline .
RESULTS	Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant differences among the interventions in improving QoL , functional disability , and positive symptoms over time in the patients .
RESULTS	Education and PMR alone resulted in sustained improvement of QoL during the intervention period and a 10-week follow-up but had no significant effects on functional disability or positive schizophrenia symptoms .
RESULTS	In contrast , combined intervention with education and PMR showed better effects on improving QoL than did education or PMR alone throughout the 15-week study .
RESULTS	It also statistically significantly improved functional disability and positive schizophrenia symptoms during the intervention period and led to sustained improvement of functional disability during the 10-week follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	A combined intervention with education and PMR is effective in improving QoL , functional disability , and positive symptoms in patients with acute schizophrenia .
CONCLUSIONS	The combined intervention model could be a new paradigm of adjunctive treatment for acute schizophrenia .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the impact of radiological expertise on screen result decisions in a CT lung cancer screening trial .
METHODS	In the NELSON lung cancer screening trial , the baseline CT result was based on the largest lung nodule 's volume .
METHODS	The protocol allowed radiologists to manually adjust screen results in cases of high suspicion of benign or malignant nodule nature .
METHODS	Participants whose baseline CT result was based on a solid or part-solid nodule were included in this study .
METHODS	Adjustments by radiologists at baseline were evaluated .
METHODS	Histology was the reference for diagnosis or to confirm benignity and stability on subsequent CT examinations .
RESULTS	A total of 3,318 participants ( 2,796 male , median age 58.0 years ) were included .
RESULTS	In 195 participants ( 5.9 % ) the initial baseline screen result was adjusted by the radiologist .
RESULTS	Adjustment was downwards from positive or indeterminate to negative in two and 119 participants , respectively , and from positive to indeterminate in 65 participants .
RESULTS	None of these nodules turned out to be malignant .
RESULTS	In 9/195 participants ( 4.6 % ) the screen result was adjusted upwards from negative to indeterminate or indeterminate to positive ; two nodules were malignant .
CONCLUSIONS	In one in 20 cases of baseline lung cancer screening , nodules were reclassified by the radiologist , leading to a reduction of false-positive screen results .

BACKGROUND	Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune targeting of the pancreatic cells , likely mediated by effector memory T ( Tem ) cells .
BACKGROUND	CD2 , a T cell surface protein highly expressed on Tem cells , is targeted by the fusion protein alefacept , depleting Tem cells and central memory T ( Tcm ) cells .
BACKGROUND	We postulated that alefacept would arrest autoimmunity and preserve residual cells in patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes .
METHODS	The T1DAL study is a phase 2 , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in patients with type 1 diabetes , aged 12-35 years who , within 100 days of diagnosis , were enrolled at 14 US sites .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned ( 2:1 ) to receive alefacept ( two 12-week courses of 15 mg intramuscularly per week , separated by a 12-week pause ) or a placebo .
METHODS	Randomisation was stratified by site , and was computer-generated with permuted blocks of three patients per block .
METHODS	All participants and site personnel were masked to treatment assignment .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean 2 h C-peptide area under the curve ( AUC ) at 12 months .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints at 12 months were the change from baseline in the 4 h C-peptide AUC , insulin use , major hypoglycaemic events , and HbA1c concentrations .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00965458 .
RESULTS	Of 73 patients assessed for eligibility , 33 were randomly assigned to receive alefacept and 16 to receive placebo .
RESULTS	The mean 2 h C-peptide AUC at 12 months increased by 0.015 nmol/L ( 95 % CI -0.080 to 0.110 ) in the alefacept group and decreased by 0.115 nmol/L ( -0.278 to 0.047 ) in the placebo group , and the difference between groups was not significant ( p = 0.065 ) .
RESULTS	However , key secondary endpoints were met : the mean 4 h C-peptide AUC was significantly higher ( mean increase of 0.015 nmol/L [ 95 % CI -0.076 to 0.106 ] vs decrease of -0.156 nmol/L [ -0.305 to -0.006 ] ; p = 0.019 ) , and daily insulin use ( 0.48 units per kg per day for placebo vs 0.36 units per kg per day for alefacept ; p = 0.02 ) and the rate of hypoglycaemic events ( mean of 10.9 events per person per year for alefacept vs 17.3 events for placebo ; p < 0.0001 ) was significantly lower at 12 months in the alefacept group than in the placebo group .
RESULTS	Mean HbA1c concentrations at week 52 were not different between treatment groups ( p = 0.75 ) .
RESULTS	So far , no serious adverse events were reported and all patients had at least one adverse event .
RESULTS	In the alefacept group , 29 ( 88 % ) participants had an adverse event related to study drug versus 15 ( 94 % ) participants in the placebo group .
RESULTS	In the alefacept group , 14 ( 42 % ) participants had grade 3 or 4 adverse events compared with nine ( 56 % ) participants in the placebo group ; no deaths occurred .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the primary outcome was not met , at 12 months , alefacept preserved the 4 h C-peptide AUC , lowered insulin use , and reduced hypoglycaemic events , suggesting efficacy .
CONCLUSIONS	Safety and tolerability were similar in the alefacept and placebo groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Alefacept could be useful to preserve - cell function in patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes .

OBJECTIVE	Myopia has reached epidemic levels in parts of East and Southeast Asia .
OBJECTIVE	However , there is no effective intervention to prevent the development of myopia .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the efficacy of increasing time spent outdoors at school in preventing incident myopia .
METHODS	Cluster randomized trial of children in grade 1 from 12 primary schools in Guangzhou , China , conducted between October 2010 and October 2013 .
METHODS	For 6 intervention schools ( n = 952 students ) , 1 additional 40-minute class of outdoor activities was added to each school day , and parents were encouraged to engage their children in outdoor activities after school hours , especially during weekends and holidays .
METHODS	Children and parents in the 6 control schools ( n = 951 students ) continued their usual pattern of activity .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was the 3-year cumulative incidence rate of myopia ( defined using the Refractive Error Study in Children spherical equivalent refractive error standard of -0.5 diopters [ D ] ) among the students without established myopia at baseline .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures were changes in spherical equivalent refraction and axial length among all students , analyzed using mixed linear models and intention-to-treat principles .
METHODS	Data from the right eyes were used for the analysis .
RESULTS	There were 952 children in the intervention group and 951 in the control group with a mean ( SD ) age of 6.6 ( 0.34 ) years .
RESULTS	The cumulative incidence rate of myopia was 30.4 % in the intervention group ( 259 incident cases among 853 eligible participants ) and 39.5 % ( 287 incident cases among 726 eligible participants ) in the control group ( difference of -9.1 % [ 95 % CI , -14.1 % to -4.1 % ] ; P < .001 ) .
RESULTS	There was also a significant difference in the 3-year change in spherical equivalent refraction for the intervention group ( -1.42 D ) compared with the control group ( -1.59 D ) ( difference of 0.17 D [ 95 % CI , 0.01 to 0.33 D ] ; P = .04 ) .
RESULTS	Elongation of axial length was not significantly different between the intervention group ( 0.95 mm ) and the control group ( 0.98 mm ) ( difference of -0.03 mm [ 95 % CI , -0.07 to 0.003 mm ] ; P = .07 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Among 6-year-old children in Guangzhou , China , the addition of 40 minutes of outdoor activity at school compared with usual activity resulted in a reduced incidence rate of myopia over the next 3 years .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to assess long-term follow-up of these children and the generalizability of these findings .

BACKGROUND	Online formative assessment continues to be an important area of research and methods which actively engage the learner and provide useful learning outcomes are of particular interest .
BACKGROUND	This study reports on the outcomes of a two year study of medical students using formative assessment tools .
METHODS	The study was conducted over two consecutive years using two different strategies for engaging students .
METHODS	The Year 1 strategy involved voluntary use of the formative assessment tool by 129 students .
METHODS	In Year 2 , a second cohort of 130 students was encouraged to complete the formative assessment by incorporating summative assessment elements into it .
METHODS	Outcomes from pre and post testing students around the formative assessment intervention were used as measures of learning .
METHODS	To compare improvement scores between the two years a two-way Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA ) model was fitted to the data .
RESULTS	The ANOVA model showed that there was a significant difference in improvement scores between students in the two years ( mean improvement percentage 19 % vs. 38.5 % , p < 0.0001 ) .
RESULTS	Students were more likely to complete formative assessment items if they had a summative component .
RESULTS	In Year 2 , the time spent using the formative assessment tool had no impact on student improvement , nor did the number of assessment items completed .
CONCLUSIONS	The online medium is a valuable learning resource , capable of providing timely formative feedback and stimulating student-centered learning .
CONCLUSIONS	However the production of quality content is a time-consuming task and careful consideration must be given to the strategies employed to ensure its efficacy .
CONCLUSIONS	Course designers should consider the potential positive impact summative components to formative assessment may have on student engagement and outcomes .

OBJECTIVE	Estimate association between postpartum antiretroviral adherence and breast milk HIV-1 transmission .
METHODS	Prospective cohort study .
METHODS	Mother-infant pairs were randomized after delivery to immediately begin receiving 28 weeks of either triple maternal antiretrovirals ( zidovudine , lamivudine , and either nevirapine , nelfinavir , or lopinavir-ritonavir ) or daily infant nevirapine as part of the Breastfeeding , Antiretrovirals , and Nutrition ( BAN ) study .
METHODS	Associations between postpartum antiretroviral adherence and rate of breast milk HIV-1 transmission were estimated using Cox models .
METHODS	We measured adherence over four postpartum time intervals using pill count , suspension bottle weight , and maternal self-report .
METHODS	Adherence was categorized and lagged by one interval .
METHODS	Missing adherence measures were multiply imputed .
METHODS	Infant HIV-1 infection was determined by DNA PCR every 2-6 weeks .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was infant HIV-1 infection by 38 weeks of age among infants alive and uninfected at 5 weeks .
RESULTS	Analyses included 1479 mother-infant pairs and 45 transmission events .
RESULTS	Using pill count and bottle weight information , 22-40 % of mother-infant pairs at any given interval were less than 90 % adherent .
RESULTS	Having at least 90 % adherence was associated with a 52 % [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 3-76 ] relative reduction in the rate of breast milk HIV-1 transmission , compared with having less than 90 % adherence when controlling for study arm , breastfeeding status , and maternal characteristics .
RESULTS	Complete case analysis rendered similar results ( n = 501 ; relative reduction 59 % , 95 % CI 6-82 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Nonadherence to extended postpartum antiretroviral regimens in ` real world ' settings is likely to be higher than that seen in BAN .
CONCLUSIONS	Identifying mothers with difficulty adhering to antiretrovirals , and developing effective adherence interventions , will help maximize benefits of antiretroviral provision throughout breastfeeding .

BACKGROUND	The Fontan procedure has improved survival in children with functionally univentricular hearts .
BACKGROUND	With time , however , complications such as reduced exercise capacity are seen more frequently .
BACKGROUND	Exercise intolerance is multifactorial , but pulmonary vascular resistance probably plays a crucial role .
BACKGROUND	Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance has been associated with raised levels of endothelin-1 , which are common both before and after Fontan operations .
BACKGROUND	Treatment with endothelin-1 receptor antagonists could theoretically improve cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and exercise capacity .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was therefore to examine the efficacy and safety of bosentan in Fontan patients .
RESULTS	Seventy-five adolescents and adults were randomized 1:1 to 14 weeks of treatment with bosentan or placebo .
RESULTS	Cardiopulmonary exercise test , functional class , blood samples , and quality-of-life questionnaires were evaluated at baseline and at the end of treatment .
RESULTS	Sixty-nine patients ( 92 % ) completed the study .
RESULTS	Peak oxygen consumption increased 2.0 mLkg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ( from 28.7 to 30.7 mLkg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ) in the bosentan group compared with 0.6 mLkg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ( from 28.4 to 29.0 mLkg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ) in the placebo group ( P = 0.02 ) .
RESULTS	Cardiopulmonary exercise test time increased by 0.48 minute ( from 6.79 to 7.27 minutes ) versus 0.08 minute ( from 6.94 to 7.02 minutes ; P = 0.04 ) .
RESULTS	Nine bosentan-treated patients improved 1 functional class , whereas none improved in the placebo group ( P = 0.0085 ) .
RESULTS	Side effects were mild and occurred equally in both groups .
RESULTS	No serious adverse effects were seen , and no patients had liver enzyme levels above the 3-fold upper limit .
CONCLUSIONS	Bosentan improves exercise capacity , exercise time , and functional class in Fontan patients without serious adverse events or hepatotoxicity .

RESULTS	The glucose response was significantly lower at 2 hours in group 2 ( p < 0.001 ) compared to group 1 or group 2 .
RESULTS	A significant difference was also seen in group 1 and 3 ( p < 0.0001 ) .
RESULTS	The plasma glucose level in response to honey peaked at 60 min and showed a rapid decline compared to that of glucose , indicating a lower glycaemic response of honey .
RESULTS	A small proportion of patients 3 ( 10.7 % ) even showed a glucose lowering effect after low dose of honey .
CONCLUSIONS	Low dose of honey can be a valuable sugar substitute for patients with diabetes .

BACKGROUND	Older adults can benefit from physical activity in numerous ways .
BACKGROUND	Physical activity is considered to be one of the few ways to influence the level of frailty .
BACKGROUND	Standardized exercise programs do not necessarily lead to more physical activity in daily life , however , and a more personalized approach seems appropriate .
BACKGROUND	The main objective of this study is to investigate whether a focused , problem-oriented coaching intervention ( ` Coach2Move ' ) delivered by a physiotherapist specializing in geriatrics is more effective for improving physical activity , mobility and health status in community-dwelling older adults than usual physiotherapy care .
BACKGROUND	In addition , cost-effectiveness will be determined .
METHODS	The design of this study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial in thirteen physiotherapy practices .
METHODS	Randomization will take place at the individual patient level .
METHODS	The study population consists of older adults , 70 years of age , with decreased physical functioning and mobility and/or a physically inactive lifestyle .
METHODS	The intervention group will receive geriatric physiotherapy according to the Coach2Move strategy .
METHODS	The control group will receive the usual physiotherapy care .
METHODS	Measurements will be performed by research assistants not aware of group assignment .
METHODS	The results will be evaluated on the amount of physical activity ( LASA Physical Activity Questionnaire ) , mobility ( modified ` get up and go ' test , walking speed and six-minute walking test ) , quality of life ( SF-36 ) , degree of frailty ( Evaluative Frailty Index for Physical Activity ) , fatigue ( NRS-fatigue ) , perceived effect ( Global Perceived Effect and Patient Specific Complaints questionnaire ) and health care costs .
CONCLUSIONS	Most studies on the effect of exercise or physical activity consist of standardized programs .
CONCLUSIONS	In this study , a personalized approach is evaluated within a group of frail older adults , many of whom suffer from multiple and complex diseases and problems .
CONCLUSIONS	A complicating factor in evaluating a new approach is that it may not be automatically adopted by clinicians .
CONCLUSIONS	Specific actions are undertaken to optimize implementation of the Coach2Move strategy during the trial .
CONCLUSIONS	Whether or not these will be sufficient is a matter we will consider subsequently , using quality indicators and process analysis .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate and compare the effects of two chest physiotherapy interventions in patients hospitalized due to acute bronchiolitis .
METHODS	Prospective randomized study with a sample of 83 calls for 29 patients aged between 3 months and 1 year hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis .
METHODS	Patients were distributed randomly into two groups : Group 1 , submitted to postural drainage , tapping and tracheal aspiration ; and Group 2 , submitted to postural drainage , expiratory acceleration flow and tracheal aspiration .
METHODS	Assessments were made before and 10 and 60 minutes after the end of therapy .
METHODS	Patients also underwent drug treatment .
METHODS	The endpoint was to compare two physical therapy interventions as to clinical improvement in infants with acute bronchiolitis by means of oxygen saturation and the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument score .
METHODS	The parents/guardians was requested to answer a questionnaire about the treatment applied before the last evaluation in order to measure their satisfaction related to the interventions made .
RESULTS	The groups were similar regarding the use of antibiotics and bronchodilators .
RESULTS	A greater number of patients used corticosteroids in Group 2 .
RESULTS	A relevant improvement was observed on Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument score with physical therapy , with reduction of the score 10 minutes after interventions , and the same score 60 minutes later , with no differences between techniques applied .
RESULTS	There was no significant variation of pulse oximetry after chest physiotherapy .
RESULTS	Most items assessed by the questionnaire had satisfactory answers .
CONCLUSIONS	No differences were observed between groups regarding the items assessed ( time required to discharge from study , pulse oximetry in room air and disease severity according to the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument score ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Parents answered positively about the effects of therapy in the majority of items in the questionnaire , both for the expiratory acceleration flow technique and for tapping .

OBJECTIVE	The present study was conducted to compare and evaluate the relative efficacy of enamel microabrasion ( using 18 % HCl ) and bleaching with McInnes solution in the esthetic improvement of fluorosed teeth and to check postoperative sensitivity .
METHODS	30 children aged between 9-14yrs with a mild or moderate grade of fluorosis as classified according to Dean 's fluorosis index and who complained of objectionable esthetics were selected .
METHODS	Split mouth study design was selected in our study .
METHODS	Each subject had one of their maxillary central incisor randomly selected for Enamel microabrasion and the contra lateral maxillary central incisor for McInnes bleaching .
METHODS	Esthetic improvement was assessed by comparing the pre and postoperative digital photographs .
METHODS	During the evaluation session , the pre and postoperative photographs of 30 subjects were incorporated into a power point presentation and were projected side by side in a darkened room .
METHODS	Four calibrated and blinded examiners , including a layman rated the photographs under standardized viewing conditions .
METHODS	Esthetic improvement was assessed for both short and long term improvement .
METHODS	The postoperative sensitivity was recorded for both the procedures immediately after treatment and at one , three and six months interval .
RESULTS	The results proved that both immediate and long term ( 6 month ) esthetic improvement achieved by McInnes bleaching were superior to enamel microabrasion .
RESULTS	There is a reduction in aesthetics of teeth in both the procedures after six months , which was very minimal in McInnes procedure and significant in enamel micro abrasion .
RESULTS	Postoperative sensitivity in both techniques were negligible .
RESULTS	The sensitivity observed were transient and subsided within an one-month post operatively .
RESULTS	None of the subjects reported sensitivity at one , three and six months intervals .
CONCLUSIONS	McInnes bleaching is a better procedure compared to enamel microabrasion in improving the appearance of fluorosed teeth .
CONCLUSIONS	Both techniques are conservative and safe .

BACKGROUND	The effectiveness of intermittent montelukast for wheeze in young children is unclear .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess whether intermittent montelukast is better than placebo for treatment of wheeze in this age group .
BACKGROUND	Because copy numbers of the Sp1-binding motif in the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase ( ALOX5 ) gene promoter ( either 5/5 , 5/x , or x/x , where x does not equal 5 ) modifies response to montelukast in adults , we stratified by this genotype .
METHODS	We did this multicentre , parallel-group , randomised , placebo-controlled trial between Oct 1 , 2010 , and Dec 20 , 2013 , at 21 primary care sites and 41 secondary care sites in England and Scotland .
METHODS	Children aged 10 months to 5 years with two or more wheeze episodes were allocated to either a 5/5 or 5/x + x/x ALOX5 promoter genotype stratum , then randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) via a permuted block schedule ( size ten ) , to receive intermittent montelukast or placebo given by parents at each wheeze episode over a 12 month period .
METHODS	Clinical investigators and parents were masked to treatment group and genotype strata .
METHODS	The primary outcome was number of unscheduled medical attendances for wheezing episodes .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01142505 .
RESULTS	We randomly assigned 1358 children to receive montelukast ( n = 669 ) or placebo ( n = 677 ) .
RESULTS	Consent was withdrawn for 12 ( 1 % ) children .
RESULTS	Primary outcome data were available for 1308 ( 96 % ) children .
RESULTS	There was no difference in unscheduled medical attendances for wheezing episodes between children in the montelukast and placebo groups ( mean 20 [ SD 26 ] vs 23 [ 27 ] ; incidence rate ratio [ IRR ] 088 , 95 % CI : 077-101 ; p = 006 ) .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo , unscheduled medical attendances for wheezing episodes were reduced in children given montelukast in the 5/5 stratum ( 20 [ 27 ] vs 24 [ 30 ] ; IRR 080 , 95 % CI 068-095 ; p = 001 ) , but not in those in the 5/x + x/x stratum ( 20 [ 25 ] vs 20 [ 23 ] ; 103 , 083-129 ; p = 079 , pinteraction = 008 ) .
RESULTS	We recorded one serious adverse event , which was a skin reaction in a child allocated to placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings show no clear benefit of intermittent montelukast in young children with wheeze .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the 5/5 ALOX5 promoter genotype might identify a montelukast-responsive subgroup .

BACKGROUND	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) is a progressive airway disease characterised by neutrophilic airway inflammation or bronchitis .
BACKGROUND	Neutrophilic bronchitis is associated with both bacterial colonisation and lung function decline and is common in exacerbations of COPD .
BACKGROUND	Despite current available therapies to control inflammation , neutrophilic bronchitis remains common .
BACKGROUND	This study tested the hypothesis that azithromycin treatment , as an add-on to standard medication , would significantly reduce airway neutrophil and neutrophils chemokine ( CXCL8 ) levels , as well as bacterial load .
BACKGROUND	We conducted a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled study in COPD participants with stable neutrophilic bronchitis .
METHODS	Eligible participants ( n = 30 ) were randomised to azithromycin 250 mg daily or placebo for 12 weeks in addition to their standard respiratory medications .
METHODS	Sputum was induced at screening , randomisation and monthly for a 12 week treatment period and processed for differential cell counts , CXCL8 and neutrophil elastase assessment .
METHODS	Quantitative bacteriology was assessed in sputum samples at randomisation and the end of treatment visit .
METHODS	Severe exacerbations where symptoms increased requiring unscheduled treatment were recorded during the 12 week treatment period and for 14 weeks following treatment .
METHODS	A sub-group of participants underwent chest computed tomography scans ( n = 15 ) .
RESULTS	Nine participants with neutrophilic bronchitis had a potentially pathogenic bacteria isolated and the median total bacterial load of all participants was 5.22107 cfu/mL .
RESULTS	Azithromycin treatment resulted in a non-significant reduction in sputum neutrophil proportion , CXCL8 levels and bacterial load .
RESULTS	The mean severe exacerbation rate was 0.33 per person per 26 weeks in the azithromycin group compared to 0.93 exacerbations per person in the placebo group ( incidence rate ratio ( 95 % CI ) : 0.37 ( 0.11,1.21 ) , p = 0.062 ) .
RESULTS	For participants who underwent chest CT scans , no alterations were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	In stable COPD with neutrophilic bronchitis , add-on azithromycin therapy showed a trend to reduced severe exacerbations sputum neutrophils , CXCL8 levels and bacterial load .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies with a larger sample size are warranted .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to evaluate fixation location and oculomotor characteristics of 15 patients with Leber congenital amaurosis ( LCA ) caused by RPE65 mutations ( RPE65-LCA ) who underwent retinal gene therapy .
METHODS	Eye movements were quantified under infrared imaging of the retina while the subject fixated on a stationary target .
METHODS	In a subset of patients , letter recognition under retinal imaging was performed .
METHODS	Cortical responses to visual stimulation were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) in two patients before and after therapy .
RESULTS	All patients were able to fixate on a 1 diameter visible target in the dark .
RESULTS	The preferred retinal locus of fixation was either at the anatomical fovea or at an extrafoveal locus .
RESULTS	There were a wide range of oculomotor abnormalities .
RESULTS	Natural history showed little change in oculomotor abnormalities if target illuminance was increased to maintain target visibility as the disease progressed .
RESULTS	Eleven of 15 study eyes treated with gene therapy showed no differences from baseline fixation locations or instability over an average of follow-up of 3.5 years .
RESULTS	Four of 15 eyes developed new pseudo-foveas in the treated retinal regions 9 to 12 months after therapy that persisted for up to 6 years ; patients used their pseudo-foveas for letter identification .
RESULTS	fMRI studies demonstrated that preservation of light sensitivity was restricted to the cortical projection zone of the pseudo-foveas .
CONCLUSIONS	The slow emergence of pseudo-foveas many months after the initial increases in light sensitivity points to a substantial plasticity of the adult visual system and a complex interaction between it and the progression of underlying retinal disease .
CONCLUSIONS	The visual significance of pseudo-foveas suggests careful consideration of treatment zones for future gene therapy trials .
CONCLUSIONS	( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00481546 . )

BACKGROUND	Data on the protein requirements of elderly adults are limited , because it is impractical to conduct repeated nitrogen balance protocols in these vulnerable humans .
OBJECTIVE	This study was designed to determine the dietary protein requirement of elderly women by using the recently developed minimally invasive indicator amino acid oxidation ( IAAO ) technique .
METHODS	Six white women aged 80-87 y [ mean SEM : 82 1 y and body mass index ( in kg/m ) 26 2 ] completed a 3-d protocol 7 times .
METHODS	Each woman consumed an adaptation diet for 2 d and on day 3 consumed a complete test diet with a crystalline amino acid mixture containing 1 of 7 protein intakes ( 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.6 , 0.9 , 1.2 , 1.5 , or 1.8 g kg d ) tested randomly .
METHODS	A group-based protein requirement was assessed by using a nonlinear mixed model of protein intake and L - [ 1-C ] phenylalanine oxidation .
METHODS	The breakpoint , at which there was no further decline in the rate of appearance of C in the breath , was used as an index of the mean protein requirement .
RESULTS	The mean protein requirement ( 95 % CI ) was 0.85 ( 0.60 , 1.09 ) g kg d.
RESULTS	This requirement is 29 % higher than the current Estimated Average Requirement ( EAR ) for adults of 0.66 g kg d based on the nitrogen balance technique , although the 95 % CI includes the current EAR .
RESULTS	The corresponding adequate protein allowance of 1.15 ( 0.77 , 1.54 ) g kg d is 44 % higher , although the 95 % CI includes the Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA ) of 0.80 g kg d.
CONCLUSIONS	Notwithstanding uncertainty about the validity of the use of the IAAO technique to assess protein requirements , the results of this study with octogenarian women suggest that the current EAR and RDA for elderly women may be underestimated .
CONCLUSIONS	The limitations of this short-term , noninvasive method underscore the need for new research that uses alternative experimental designs and measuring physiologic , morphologic , and health-related outcomes .

BACKGROUND	Physician-rating websites combine public reporting with social networking and offer an attractive means by which users can provide feedback on their physician and obtain information about other patients ' satisfaction and experiences .
BACKGROUND	However , research on how users evaluate information on these portals is still scarce and only little knowledge is available about the potential influence of physician reviews on a patient 's choice .
OBJECTIVE	Starting from the perspective of prospective patients , this paper sets out to explore how certain characteristics of physician reviews affect the evaluation of the review and users ' attitudes toward the rated physician .
OBJECTIVE	We propose a model that relates review style and review number to constructs of review acceptance and check it with a Web-based experiment .
METHODS	We employed a randomized 2x2 between-subject , factorial experiment manipulating the style of a physician review ( factual vs emotional ) and the number of reviews for a certain physician ( low vs high ) to test our hypotheses .
METHODS	A total of 168 participants were presented with a Web-based questionnaire containing a short description of a dentist search scenario and the manipulated reviews for a fictitious dental physician .
METHODS	To investigate the proposed hypotheses , we carried out moderated regression analyses and a moderated mediation analysis using the PROCESS macro 2.11 for SPSS version 22 .
RESULTS	Our analyses indicated that a higher number of reviews resulted in a more positive attitude toward the rated physician .
RESULTS	The results of the regression model for attitude toward the physician suggest a positive main effect of the number of reviews ( mean [ low ] 3.73 , standard error [ SE ] 0.13 , mean [ high ] 4.15 , SE 0.13 ) .
RESULTS	We also observed an interaction effect with the style of the reviewif the physician received only a few reviews , fact-oriented reviews ( mean 4.09 , SE 0.19 ) induced a more favorable attitude toward the physician compared to emotional reviews ( mean 3.44 , SE 0.19 ) , but there was no such effect when the physician received many reviews .
RESULTS	Furthermore , we found that review style also affected the perceived expertise of the reviewer .
RESULTS	Fact-oriented reviews ( mean 3.90 , SE 0.13 ) lead to a higher perception of reviewer expertise compared to emotional reviews ( mean 3.19 , SE 0.13 ) .
RESULTS	However , this did not transfer to the attitude toward the physician .
RESULTS	A similar effect of review style and number on the perceived credibility of the review was observed .
RESULTS	While no differences between emotional and factual style were found if the physician received many reviews , a low number of reviews received lead to a significant difference in the perceived credibility , indicating that emotional reviews were rated less positively ( mean 3.52 , SE 0.18 ) compared to fact-oriented reviews ( mean 4.15 , SE 0.17 ) .
RESULTS	Our analyses also showed that perceived credibility of the review fully mediated the observed interaction effect on attitude toward the physician .
CONCLUSIONS	Physician-rating websites are an interesting new source of information about the quality of health care from the patient 's perspective .
CONCLUSIONS	This paper makes a unique contribution to an understudied area of research by providing some insights into how people evaluate online reviews of individual doctors .
CONCLUSIONS	Information attributes , such as review style and review number , have an impact on the evaluation of the review and on the patient 's attitude toward the rated doctor .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research is necessary to improve our understanding of the influence of such rating sites on the patient 's choice of a physician .

BACKGROUND	Subcutaneous ondansetron facilitated by recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 ( rHuPH20 ) is an alternative for treating nausea/vomiting in patients who can not receive ondansetron by other routes of administration .
OBJECTIVE	Based on preclinical results in minipigs , a Phase I study was designed to assess the tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties of subcutaneous ondansetron + rHuPH20 compared with intramuscular , intravenous , or oral ondansetron monotherapy in healthy volunteers .
METHODS	In a crossover design , 3 minipigs were dosed with subcutaneous ondansetron 0.08 mg/kg + rHuPH20 , or as intramuscular or intravenous monotherapy , for the evaluation of plasma ondansetron concentrations and local tolerability .
METHODS	In a randomized , open-label , 4-way crossover study , subjects received a randomized sequence of SC ondansetron 4 mg + rHuPH20 , or ondansetron monotherapy IM ( 4 mg ) , IV ( 4 mg ) , or PO ( 8 mg ) , over 4 daily visits .
METHODS	Study participants included healthy volunteers aged 19 to 65 years with adequate venous access in both upper extremities and no history of QT-interval prolongation .
METHODS	Primary tolerability end points ( administration-site observations , systemic adverse events [ AEs ] , and subject-assessed pain ) were assessed , and pharmacokinetic parameters ( AUC , Cmax , Tmax , t ) were computed to compare relative rate and extent of systemic exposure .
METHODS	Results were described using summary statistics , and bioequivalence was determined with a linear mixed-effects model .
RESULTS	In the preclinical study , no adverse events or significant local reactions were observed .
RESULTS	The Cmax ( 45.8 ng/mL at 0.08 hour ) with subcutaneous administration + rHuPH20 was 83 % greater and was achieved 68 % faster than with intramuscular administration ( Cmax = 25 ng/mL at 0.25 hour ) .
RESULTS	In the clinical study , a total of 12 subjects ( 7 women , 5 men ; white majority ; mean age , 44.8 ) were randomized .
RESULTS	The majority of AEs were at the injection site , mild in severity , and transient .
RESULTS	After subcutaneous administration of ondansetron + rHuPH20 , geometric mean Cmax was 35 % higher than with intramuscular ondansetron , 43 % lower than with intravenous ondansetron , and 126 % higher than with oral ondansetron ( corrected for dose ) .
RESULTS	Bioequivalence tests demonstrated that systemic exposure after subcutaneous administration was similar to that after intramuscular or intravenous administration and significantly greater than that after oral administration .
CONCLUSIONS	Subcutaneous ondansetron + rHuPH20 was generally well-tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	Subcutaneous dosing resulted in an extent of systemic exposure similar to that with intramuscular or intravenous dosing and greater than that with oral administration , and may be an option for clinical administration of ondansetron .
CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT01572012 .

OBJECTIVE	Pharmacokinetics , safety , and tolerability of GSK1265744 ( 744 ) and rilpivirine ( RPV ) ( TMC278 ) were assessed after repeat dosing of long-acting ( LA ) injectable formulations in healthy subjects .
METHODS	Subjects received a 14-day lead-in of oral 744 ( 30 mg/d ) to assess safety and tolerability before injectable administration .
METHODS	Subjects were randomized into 4 cohorts : 800 mg of 744 LA intramuscularly ( IM ) followed by 3 monthly doses of ( 1 ) 200 mg subcutaneously , ( 2 ) 200 mg IM , ( 3 ) 400 mg IM , or ( 4 ) a second injection of 800 mg IM after 12 weeks .
METHODS	Cohorts 2 and 3 also received IM doses of RPV LA at months 3 ( 1200 mg ) and 4 ( 900 or 600 mg ) .
METHODS	Pharmacokinetics and safety were assessed throughout the trial .
RESULTS	Forty-seven subjects enrolled ; 40 received 1 LA injection with 37 completing all planned injections .
RESULTS	Seven subjects discontinued 744 oral ( non-drug-related , n = 6 ; dizziness , n = 1 ) .
RESULTS	The 744 LA and RPV LA injections were generally well tolerated , with grade 1 injection site reactions most commonly reported .
RESULTS	Three subjects discontinued during injection phase ( consent withdrawn , n = 2 ; self-limited rash , n = 1 ) .
RESULTS	There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events and no clinically significant trends in laboratory abnormalities , electrocardiograms , or vital signs .
RESULTS	All dose cohorts achieved therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations of each drug within 3 days with prolonged exposure over the dosing interval .
RESULTS	Plasma concentrations of 744 exceeded the protein-adjusted IC90 and RPV plasma concentrations and were comparable to steady-state oral RPV 25 mg/d .
CONCLUSIONS	These data support the potential application of dual-therapy 744 LA and RPV LA for treatment of HIV-1 infection .

OBJECTIVE	Gluten ingestion leads to small intestinal mucosal injury in patients with celiac disease , necessitating strict life-long exclusion of dietary gluten .
OBJECTIVE	Despite adherence to a gluten-free diet , many patients remain symptomatic and still have small intestinal inflammation .
OBJECTIVE	In this case , nondietary therapies are needed .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated the ability of ALV003 , a mixture of 2 recombinant gluten-specific proteases given orally , to protect patients with celiac disease from gluten-induced mucosal injury in a phase 2 trial .
METHODS	We established the optimal daily dose of gluten to be used in a 6-week challenge study .
METHODS	Then , in the intervention study , adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease were randomly assigned to groups given ALV003 ( n = 20 ) or placebo ( n = 21 ) together with the daily gluten challenge .
METHODS	Duodenal biopsies were collected at baseline and after gluten challenge .
METHODS	The ratio of villus height to crypt depth and densities of intraepithelial lymphocytes were the primary end points .
RESULTS	A daily dose of 2 g gluten was selected for the intervention study .
RESULTS	Sixteen patients given ALV003 and 18 given placebo were eligible for efficacy evaluation .
RESULTS	Biopsies from subjects in the placebo group showed evidence of mucosal injury after gluten challenge ( mean villus height to crypt depth ratio changed from 2.8 before challenge to 2.0 afterward ; P = .0007 ; density of CD3 ( + ) intraepithelial lymphocytes changed from 61 to 91 cells/mm after challenge ; P = .0003 ) .
RESULTS	However , no significant mucosal deterioration was observed in biopsies from the ALV003 group .
RESULTS	Between groups , morphologic changes and CD3 ( + ) intraepithelial lymphocyte counts differed significantly from baseline to week 6 ( P = .0133 and P = .0123 , respectively ) .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences in symptoms between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on a phase 2 trial , the glutenase ALV003 appears to attenuate gluten-induced small intestinal mucosal injury in patients with celiac disease in the context of an everyday gluten-free diet containing daily up to 2 g gluten .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study is to validate the efficacy of intensive statin therapy for patients with atherosclerotic intracranial arterial stenosis ( AICAS ) .
METHODS	In this study , we performed a single-center , randomized , single-blind , parallel-group clinical trial .
METHODS	A total of 120 Chinese patients with AICAS were enrolled and randomly divided into three groups [ low-dose atorvastatin therapy ( LAT , 10mg/day ) , standard-dose atorvastatin therapy ( SAT , 20mg/day ) , and intensive-dose atorvastatin therapy ( IAT , 40mg/day ) groups ] in a 1:1:1 ratio .
METHODS	Evaluation variables , including changes in serum lipid profiles , degree of stenosis , and perfusion-related parameters derived from computed tomography perfusion ( CTP ) imaging from baseline to weeks 26 and 52 , as well as the occurrence of cerebrovascular events during the study period , were used to compare the benefits of these three statin therapies .
RESULTS	After 52 weeks of treatment , improvement of serum lipid profiles , degree of stenosis , and perfusion-related parameters were all significantly better in the IAT group .
RESULTS	In addition , the cumulative probability of cerebrovascular events at 52 weeks was significantly lower in the IAT group than in the LAT group , although there was no statistical difference between the IAT group and the SAT group .
RESULTS	The proportion of patients experiencing any adverse event was similar among the three treatment groups .
RESULTS	Adverse events caused by IAT were generally mild ; no serious adverse events occurred throughout the entire period of study .
CONCLUSIONS	In conclusion , long-term use of IAT appears to be a safe and effective treatment at least for Chinese patients with AICAS .

BACKGROUND	Carbohydrate counting ( CHC ) is ack - nowledged by the American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) as an important tool .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the efficacy of photographic educational materials to train adolescents with DM to perform CHC .
METHODS	76 adolescents were randomly divided into two groups of CHC orientation : by means of photographic materials ( Photo ) or by a list of foods ( List ) .
METHODS	One month afterwards , the participants were contacted via telephone to answer questions on CHC to reinforce the training ( Quiz ) .
METHODS	Two days after taking the quiz , required the participants to visit an experimental kitchen to observe food portions in natura and to respond to a questionnaire on the weights in grams or carbohydrate equivalents of these portions .
METHODS	Statistical significance was established at p < 0.05 .
RESULTS	54 adolescents completed the study ( 79.7 % female ) , with 51.8 % allocated to the Photo group and 48.1 % to the List group .
RESULTS	The mean age was 13.8 2.0 years old , and the mean body mass index ( BMI ) was 21.0 3.2 kg/m2 .
RESULTS	The participants had average of 7.9 1.5 years of schooling , while their parents had 8.0 3.8 years .
RESULTS	The knowledge of CHC was similar in both groups before the intervention .
RESULTS	After the intervention , the Photo group achieved a significantly higher hit difference on the CHC assessment test than the List group ( Photo : 2.5 vs List : 1.0 ; p = 0.03 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The photographic educational material was more effective in helping adolescents with DM understand and learn to perform carbohydrate counting .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the gastric emptying of an oral supplement containing carbohydrate plus whey protein drunk before sedation for gastroscopy .
METHODS	This is a randomized double-blind trial including adult patients ( ages 18-65 ) with a chief complaint of epigastric burning and who were candidates to elective gastroscopy .
METHODS	After overnight fast subjects were randomized to drink 200 mL of an oral nutritional supplement containing maltodextrine in addition to whey protein 150 to 210 min before the gastroscopy ( intervention group , n = 12 ) or to undergo the endoscopic procedure with no supplement ( control group , n = 12 ) .
METHODS	The residual gastric volume ( RGV ) suctioned and measured during the exam was the main endpoint of the study .
RESULTS	There were no complications during all exams .
RESULTS	The median ( range ) fasting time was greater ( P < 0.001 ) in control group ( 770 min , ranging from 660-917 min ) than in the study group ( 175 min ranging from 150 to 210 min ) .
RESULTS	The median ( range ) RGV was similar in between the two groups ( control group : 25 ( 10-70 ) mL versus intervention group : 10 ( 0-100 ) mL ; p = 0.32 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Gastric emptying 150-210 min after the ingestion of an oral supplement containing carbohydrate plus whey protein is similar to an overnight fasting condition .
CONCLUSIONS	Although limited by the number of cases , the sedation for endoscopic procedures is safe with this fasting protocol .

METHODS	In total , 93 patients , aged 10-25 years , with surgical repair for tetralogy of Fallot or with a Fontan circulation for single-ventricle physiology were included .
METHODS	They were randomly allocated with a ratio of 2:1 to : ( 1 ) a 12-week period with an exercise program for 3 times per week or ( 2 ) to a control group .
METHODS	Randomization was stratified by age , gender , and cardiac diagnosis .
METHODS	At baseline and follow-up after 12 weeks , all participants completed Web-based age-appropriate HRQoL questionnaires .
METHODS	Primary analyses involved change in HRQoL during follow-up .
METHODS	Secondary analyses concerned influence of cardiac diagnosis and comparison with normative data .
RESULTS	Forty-eight ( 86 % ) and 32 ( 86 % ) patients in the exercise-group and control-group respectively completed all questionnaires at baseline and follow-up .
RESULTS	Compared with the control-group , children , aged 10-15 years , in the exercise-group improved significantly on self-reported cognitive functioning , p < .05 , r = .30 , and parent-reported social functioning , p < .05 , r = .30 .
RESULTS	Youngsters aged 16-25 years did not change their HRQoL .
RESULTS	Cardiac diagnosis had no influence on pre/post changes .
RESULTS	Children and youngsters in this study reported comparable or better HRQoL than norm groups .

OBJECTIVE	Heart failure ( HF ) is associated with changes in myocardial metabolism that lead to impairment of contractile function .
OBJECTIVE	Trimetazidine ( TMZ ) modulates cardiac energetic efficiency and improves outcomes in ischemic heart disease .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the effects of TMZ on left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , cardiac metabolism , exercise capacity , O2 uptake , and quality of life in patients with nonischemic HF .
RESULTS	Sixty patients with stable nonischemic HF under optimal medical therapy were included in this randomized double-blind study .
RESULTS	Patients were randomized to TMZ ( 35 mg orally twice a day ) or placebo for 6 months .
RESULTS	LVEF , 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , maximum O2 uptake in cardiopulmonary exercise test , different markers of metabolism , oxidative stress , and endothelial function , and quality of life were assessed at baseline and after TMZ treatment .
RESULTS	Left ventricular peak glucose uptake was evaluated with the use of the maximum standardized uptake value ( SUV ) by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( ( 18 ) FDG-PET ) .
RESULTS	Etiology was idiopathic in 85 % and hypertensive in 15 % .
RESULTS	Both groups were similar in age , functional class , LVEF , and levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide at baseline .
RESULTS	After 6 months of TMZ treatment , no changes were observed in LVEF ( 31 10 % vs 34 8 % ; P = .8 ) , 6MWT ( 443 25 m vs 506 79 m ; P = .03 ) , maximum O2 uptake ( 19.1 5.0 mL kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) vs 23.0 7.2 mL kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ; P = .11 ) , functional class ( percentages of patients in functional classes I/II/III / IV 10/3753/0 vs 7/40/50 / 3 ; P = .14 ) , or quality of life ( 32 26 points vs 24 18 points ; P = .25 ) in TMZ versus placebo , respectively .
RESULTS	In the subgroup of patients evaluated with ( 18 ) FDG-PET , no significant differences were observed in SUV between both groups ( 7.0 3.6 vs 8.2 3.4 respectively ; P = .47 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with nonischemic HF , the addition of TMZ to optimal medical treatment does not result in significant changes of LVEF , exercise capacity , O2 uptake , or quality of life .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of catheter ablation in the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and the predictors of arrhythmia recurrence .
METHODS	Absence of atrial tachyarrhythmia ( AT ) recurrence during a mid-term follow-up was correlated with several clinical and procedural characteristics in a population of 82 patients aged 20-70 years who had experienced at least one documented relapse of persistent AF during a single trial of antiarrhythmic drug therapy .
METHODS	Electrophysiological success of ablation was declared when all identified PVs were isolated ( confirmation of entry and exit block ) .
METHODS	Patients were followed for a maximum of 24 months after the blanking period with outpatient visits , ECG recordings , 24-hour Holter monitoring , and weekly transtelephonic monitoring for 30s .
RESULTS	Electrophysiological success was documented in 38/82 ( 46.3 % ) patients .
RESULTS	During a mean follow-up of 24.7 4.2 months , 69/82 ( 84.1 % ) patients presented at least one episode of AT after the 2 month blanking period .
RESULTS	According to univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses , only an electrophysiologically successful ablation significantly correlated with the absence of documented AT relapse ( OR 5.32 , 95 % CL 1.02-27 .72 ; p = .0472 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Mid-term outcome of a single procedure of catheter ablation without the adjunction of antiarrhythmic drug therapy is poor in patients with persistent AF .
CONCLUSIONS	Documented PV isolation is useful to increase the success rate of circumferential PV ablation even in persistent AF patients .

BACKGROUND	Delayed primary closure in cases of acute appendicitis is debated among the surgeons as to whether it decreases the rate of wound infection in comparison to primary closure .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to find out the optimal method of wound closure in cases of perforated appendicitis .
METHODS	This randomized control trial was conducted at the surgical units of Ayub Teaching Hospital Abbottabad from May to November 2012 .
METHODS	A total of 158 patients having perforated appendicitis were included in the study .
METHODS	They were randomly divided two groups .
METHODS	The wounds were primarily closed in one group and left open with daily saline soaked dressing , to be closed on postoperative day 4 in case of the other group .
METHODS	The main outcome measure was wound infection .
METHODS	A wound was considered infected if it was discharging pus , was red and swollen on postoperative day 8th .
METHODS	The method of wound closure was considered efficacious if there was no wound infection till 8th postoperative day .
RESULTS	A total of 158 patients , 56 ( 35.4 % ) male and 102 ( 64.6 % ) female were included in the study .
RESULTS	Primary closure group had a total number of 79 patients with 26 ( 32.9 % ) male and 53 ( 67.1 % ) female .
RESULTS	Delayed primary group had also a total number of 79 patients with 30 ( 38 % ) male and 49 ( 62 % ) female .
RESULTS	The mean age of patients in the primary closure group was 26.67 7.32 years while in the delayed primary group was 28.15 6.88 years .
RESULTS	In the entire series , 36 ( 22.8 % ) patients developed wound infection .
RESULTS	There was a significant association between wound infection and type of skin closure ( Delayed Primary Closure 6.3 % vs. Primary Closure 39.2 % , p < 0.000 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Delayed Primary closure is the optimal management strategy in case of perforated appendicitis as it decreases the incidence of wound infection .

OBJECTIVE	This study sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term growth hormone ( GH ) replacement therapy in GH-deficient patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) .
BACKGROUND	Recent evidence indicates that growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) affects as many as 40 % of patients with CHF , and short-term GH replacement causes functional benefit .
BACKGROUND	Whether long-term GH replacement also affects CHF progression is unknown .
METHODS	The study is an extension of a previous randomized , controlled single-blind trial that screened 158 consecutive CHF patients ( New York Heart Association classes II to IV ) and identified 63 who had GHD by the growth hormone releasing hormone plus arginine test .
METHODS	Fifty-six patients were randomized to receive either GH therapy or standard CHF therapy .
METHODS	Patients were evaluated at baseline and after a 4-year follow-up .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was peak oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints included left ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction and volumes , serum amino terminal fragment of the pro-hormone brain-type natriuretic peptide , quality of life , and safety .
RESULTS	Seventeen patients in the GH group and 14 in the control group completed the study .
RESULTS	In the GH group , peak VO2 improved over the 4-year follow-up .
RESULTS	The treatment effect was 7.1 0.7 ml/kg/min versus -1.8 0.5 ml/kg/min in the GH and control groups , respectively .
RESULTS	At 4 years , LV ejection fraction increased by 10 3 % in the GH group , whereas it decreased by 2 5 % in control patients .
RESULTS	The treatment effect on LV end-systolic volume index was -22 6 ml and 8 3 ml/m ( 2 ) in the GH and control groups , respectively ( all p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	No major adverse events were reported in the patients who received GH .
CONCLUSIONS	Although this is a preliminary study , the finding suggests a new therapeutic approach to a large proportion of GHD patients with CHF .

BACKGROUND	It is well recognized that amounts of trans and saturated fats should be minimized in Western diets ; however , considerable debate remains regarding optimal amounts of dietary n-9 , n-6 , and n-3 fatty acids .
OBJECTIVE	The objective was to examine the effects of varying n-9 , n-6 , and longer-chain n-3 fatty acid composition on markers of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk .
METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , 5-period , crossover design was used .
METHODS	Each 4-wk treatment period was separated by 4-wk washout intervals .
METHODS	Volunteers with abdominal obesity consumed each of 5 identical weight-maintaining , fixed-composition diets with one of the following treatment oils ( 60 g/3000 kcal ) in beverages : 1 ) conventional canola oil ( Canola ; n-9 rich ) , 2 ) high-oleic acid canola oil with docosahexaenoic acid ( CanolaDHA ; n-9 and n-3 rich ) , 3 ) a blend of corn and safflower oil ( 25:75 ) ( CornSaff ; n-6 rich ) , 4 ) a blend of flax and safflower oils ( 60:40 ) ( FlaxSaff ; n-6 and short-chain n-3 rich ) , or 5 ) high-oleic acid canola oil ( CanolaOleic ; highest in n-9 ) .
RESULTS	One hundred thirty individuals completed the trial .
RESULTS	At endpoint , total cholesterol ( TC ) was lowest after the FlaxSaff phase ( P < 0.05 compared with Canola and CanolaDHA ) and highest after the CanolaDHA phase ( P < 0.05 compared with CornSaff , FlaxSaff , and CanolaOleic ) .
RESULTS	Low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol were highest , and triglycerides were lowest , after CanolaDHA ( P < 0.05 compared with the other diets ) .
RESULTS	All diets decreased TC and LDL cholesterol from baseline to treatment endpoint ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	CanolaDHA was the only diet that increased HDL cholesterol from baseline ( 3.5 1.8 % ; P < 0.05 ) and produced the greatest reduction in triglycerides ( -20.7 3.8 % ; P < 0.001 ) and in systolic blood pressure ( -3.3 0.8 % ; P < 0.001 ) compared with the other diets ( P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	Percentage reductions in Framingham 10-y CHD risk scores ( FRS ) from baseline were greatest after CanolaDHA ( -19.0 3.1 % ; P < 0.001 ) than after other treatments ( P < 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Consumption of CanolaDHA , a novel DHA-rich canola oil , improves HDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and blood pressure , thereby reducing FRS compared with other oils varying in unsaturated fatty acid composition .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01351012 .

OBJECTIVE	To assess short - and long-term outcomes of pregnant women with very early rupture of membranes randomized to serial amnioinfusion or expectant management , and to collect data to inform a larger , more definitive clinical trial .
METHODS	This was a prospective non-blinded randomized controlled trial with randomization stratified for pregnancies in which the membranes ruptured between 16 +0 and 19 +6 weeks ' gestation and 20 +0 and 23 +6 weeks ' gestation to minimize the risk of random imbalance in gestational age distribution between randomized groups .
METHODS	Intention-to-treat analysis was used .
METHODS	The study was conducted in four UK hospital-based fetal medicine units ( Liverpool Women 's NHS Trust , St Mary 's Hospital Manchester , Birmingham Women 's NHS Foundation Trust and Wirral University Hospitals Trust ) .
METHODS	The participants were women with confirmed preterm prelabor rupture of membranes at 16 +0 to 24 +0 weeks ' gestation .
METHODS	Women with multiple pregnancy , fetal abnormality or obstetric indication for immediate delivery were excluded .
METHODS	Participants were randomly allocated to either serial weekly transabdominal amnioinfusions if the deepest pool of amniotic fluid was < 2cm or expectant management until 37 weeks ' gestation .
METHODS	Short-term maternal , pregnancy and neonatal and long-term outcomes for the child were studied .
METHODS	Long-term respiratory morbidity was assessed using validated respiratory questionnaires at 6 , 12 and 18 months of age and infant lung function test at around 12 months of age .
METHODS	Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development , second edition ( BSID-II ) at corrected age of 2 years .
RESULTS	Fifty-eight women were randomized to the study .
RESULTS	Two babies were excluded from the analysis because of termination of pregnancy for lethal anomaly , leaving 56 participants ( 28 assigned to serial amnioinfusion and 28 to expectant management ) recruited between 2002 and 2009 .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in perinatal mortality ( 19/28 vs 19/28 ; relative risk ( RR ) 1.0 ( 95 % CI , 0.70-1 .43 ) ) and maternal or neonatal morbidity .
RESULTS	The overall chance of surviving without long-term respiratory or neurodevelopmental disability was 4/56 ( 7.1 % ) ; 4/28 ( 14.3 % ) in the amnioinfusion group and 0/28 in the expectant group ( RR 9.0 ( 95 % CI , 0.51-159 .70 ) ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This pilot study found no major differences in maternal , perinatal or pregnancy outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	The study was not designed to show a difference between the groups and the number of survivors was too small to draw any conclusions about long-term outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	It does , however , signal that a larger definitive study to evaluate amnioinfusion for improvement in healthy survival is needed .
CONCLUSIONS	The pilot suggests that , with appropriate funding , such a study is feasible .

OBJECTIVE	We investigated the risk of abdominal operation in patients with fatty liver and the risk of any cancer in first-degree relatives of patients with fatty liver .
METHODS	We evaluated 105 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , 121 patients with biopsy-proven hepatitis C ( 61 patients with fatty liver and 60 patients without fatty liver ) , 50 patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , and 109 patients with dyspepsia .
RESULTS	There was no difference in sex , mean age , and marital status among the groups except that patients with IBD were younger than the others ( p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	The frequency of cancer among family members was 18 % in IBD , 9 % in dyspepsia , 28 % in hepatitis C with steatosis , 21.5 % in hepatitis C without steatosis , and 27 % in NAFLD ( p = 0.006 ) .
RESULTS	Then , we divided the study group into two groups as follows : group 1 : ( IBD + dyspepsia + hepatitis C without steatosis ) and group 2 : ( hepatitis C with steatosis + NAFLD ) .
RESULTS	We found that the frequency of cancer was 16 % in group 1 versus 24.4 % in group 2 ( p = 0.037 ) .
RESULTS	We also investigated the risk of abdominal operation in patients with fatty liver .
RESULTS	The results were as follows : 33 % in group without fatty liver versus 43 % in group with fatty liver ( p = 0.043 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Understanding the underlying causes of fatty liver forms might decrease the cancer frequency in the population and number of operations in patients with fatty liver .

BACKGROUND	Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) is common and increasing in prevalence .
BACKGROUND	Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is a major cause of morbidity and death in CKD , though of a different phenotype to the general CVD population .
BACKGROUND	Few therapies have proved effective in modifying the increased CVD risk or rate of renal decline in CKD .
BACKGROUND	There are accumulating data that aldosterone receptor antagonists ( ARA ) may offer cardio-protection and delay renal impairment in patients with the CV phenotype in CKD .
BACKGROUND	The use of ARA in CKD has therefore been increasingly advocated .
BACKGROUND	However , no large study of ARA with renal or CVD outcomes is underway .
METHODS	The study is a prospective randomised open blinded endpoint ( PROBE ) trial set in primary care where patients will mainly be identified by their GPs or from existing CKD lists .
METHODS	They will be invited if they have been formally diagnosed with CKD stage 3b or there is evidence of stage 3b CKD from blood results ( eGFR 30-44mL / min/1 .73 m2 ) and fulfil the other inclusion/exclusion criteria .
METHODS	Patients will be randomised to either spironolactone 25mg once daily in addition to routine care or routine care alone and followed-up for 36months .
CONCLUSIONS	BARACK D is a PROBE trial to determine the effect of ARA on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes ( onset or progression of CVD ) in patients with stage 3b CKD .

OBJECTIVE	To assess changes in circulating incretin levels and body fat compositions with initial combination therapy with - glucosidase inhibitor and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) .
METHODS	In this multicenter open-label 24-week trial , Japanese over-weight ( BMI 25 kg/m ( 2 ) ) patients with T2D not taking medication or taking metformin and/or sulfonylurea were randomly assigned to receive either 50mg of miglitol three times a day ( M , n = 14 ) , 50mg of sitagliptin once a day ( S , n = 14 ) , or a combination of both ( M+S , n = 13 ) .
METHODS	Changes in plasma incretin levels during a meal tolerance test ( MTT ) and body fat composition with impedance method were evaluated .
RESULTS	During MTT , postprandial plasma glucose levels decreased more after M+S than after M or S , and postprandial serum insulin levels decreased significantly after M and M+S whereas they increased after S.
RESULTS	After M , active gastric inhibitory polypeptide ( aGIP ) decreased significantly at 30 min despite a significant increase at 120 min .
RESULTS	After S , aGIP levels increased significantly throughout the MTT .
RESULTS	After M+S , aGIP increased significantly at 0 and 120 min despite of significant decrease at 30 min .
RESULTS	M+S further enhanced postprandial active glucagon-like peptide-1 levels during MTT than S did .
RESULTS	Total body fat mass decreased significantly after M and M+S .
RESULTS	Visceral fat mass decreased significantly only after M+S .
RESULTS	Serum adiponectin increased significantly only after M+S .
CONCLUSIONS	In over-weight patients with T2D , M+S may have a beneficial effect on adiposity with relation to these different effects on two incretins .

OBJECTIVE	To observe the effect differences on post-stroke dysphagia among acupoint injection combined with neural electrical stimulation , acupoint injection , neural electrical stimulation , and swallowing training respectively , so eligible intervention can be applied to this kind of disease .
METHODS	One hundred and eight-three patients of post-stroke dysphagia were randomized into a comprehensive treatment group ( 42 cases ) , an acupoint injection group ( 44 cases ) , a neural electrical stimulation group ( 49 cases ) and a swallow training group ( 48 cases ) and were treated with the comprehensive therapy of acupoint injection and neural electrical stimulation , acupoint injection , neural electrical stimulation and swallowing training separately .
METHODS	The treatments for 10 days made one session .
METHODS	There were 3 days at the interval among treatment sessions and 3 sessions were required totally .
METHODS	The cases in those treatment groups were blankly controlled with the other 47 patients of post-stroke dysphagia .
METHODS	All the patients received basic rehabilitation treatment .
METHODS	The modified water swallowing test was conducted to assess the efficacy before treatment , 10 days after treatment and 30 days after treatment in each group separately .
METHODS	The clinical efficacy , score of water swallowing test and improvement in water swallow test were compared among the groups .
RESULTS	After 10-day treatment , the differences in efficacy and score of water swallow test were not significant in each group ( all P > 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	After 30-day treatment , the effective rate ( 94.29 % , 33/35 ) in the comprehensive treatment group was apparently better than 68.75 % ( 22/32 ) in the acupoint injection group , 80.00 % ( 32/40 ) in the neural electrical stimulation group , 67.50 % ( 27/40 ) in the swallowing training group and 42.86 % ( 12/28 ) in the blank group separately .
RESULTS	The score in water swallow test in the comprehensive treatment group was lower than that in each of the other groups ( 1.37 0.60 vs 2.03 1.00 , 1.90 0.90 , 2.20 0.72 , 2.71 0.90 , all P < 0.05 ) .
RESULTS	The differences in the effective rate and score in water swallow test were not significant among the acupoint injection group , neural electrical stimulation group and swallowing training group ( all P > 0.05 ) , which indicated that the improvement in swallowing function in the comprehensive treatment group was significantly superior to the other groups ( all P < 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The comprehensive therapy of acupoint injection and neural electrical stimulation achieves the much better efficacy on post-stroke dysphagia .
